# Preface Stuff {-}

## Prerequisites {-} 

This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.

For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from Github:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown")
```

Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`.

To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```

Here, I type thinks to see, if spell check works?. Noo, it does not.
Ok, how is it here?
Noop.

## My bookown testing area {-}

A test to include a .png impage as figure in bookdown.
```{r loop-example, fig.cap='The caption of my super nice PNG figure', out.width='70%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/testing/chromloop_pred_v01_edited.png")
```
I can reference this figure her (see \@ref(fig:loop-example)).
Great, now I installed a plugin to automatically add citations. Like this one [@Oti2016]. 


Example formular inline: $f(k) = {n \choose k} p^{k} (1-p)^{n-k}$
And an example to reference a figure:  Fig. \[fig:loop-example\]A
And an example to reference a figure:  Fig. \@ref(fig:loop-example)A
I can reference this figure her (see \@ref(fig:loop-example)).


## Introduction from book-down demo {-}

You can label chapter and section titles using `{#label}` after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter \@ref(intro). If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter \@ref(methods).




Figures and tables with captions will be placed in `figure` and `table` environments, respectively.

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='90%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 2)

```

Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the `fig:` prefix, e.g., see Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig). Similarly, you can reference tables generated from `knitr::kable()`, e.g., see Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(iris, 20), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

You can write citations, too. For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015].
