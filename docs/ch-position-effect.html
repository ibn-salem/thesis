<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Abstract</h2>
<p>Interpretation of variants of uncertain significance, especially chromosome rearrangements in non-coding regions of the human genome, remains one of the biggest challenges in modern molecular diagnosis. To improve our understanding and interpretation of such variants, we used high-resolution 3-dimensional chromosome structure data and transcriptional regulatory information to predict position effects and their association with pathogenic phenotypes in 17 subjects with apparently balanced chromosome abnormalities. We find that the rearrangements predict disruption of long-range chromatin interactions between several enhancers and genes whose annotated clinical features are strongly associated with the subjects’ phenotypes. We confirm gene expression changes for a couple of candidate genes to exemplify the utility of our position effect analysis. These results highlight the important interplay between chromosome structure and disease, and demonstrate the need to utilize chromatin conformation data for the prediction of position effects in the clinical interpretation of cases of non-coding chromosome rearrangements.</p>

<p>The availability of genome sequencing in the clinical setting has generated a need for rapid prediction and interpretation of structural variants, especially those pertaining to <em>de novo</em> non-coding rearrangements in individual subjects.

Using publicly available chromatin contact information, annotated and predicted regulatory elements, and correlation between phenotypes observed in DGAP subjects and those associated with neighboring genes, we reliably predicted candidate genes exhibiting mis-regulated expression in DGAP-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). These results suggest that many VUS are likely to be further interpretable via long-range effects, and warrant their routine assessment and integration in clinical diagnosis.</p>

We used two background models to assess signiﬁcance of this similarity. The ﬁrst is based on randomly permuting the associations of phenotypes to genes; to this effect, the phenotype-gene associations are shuffled 100 times randomly and the similarity of these random phenotypes to the studied case clinical findings is calculated. The second background control is based on shifting the breakpoint location along the chromosome; each breakpoint is shifted by -9, -6, -3, +3, +6, and +9 Mb and the similarity of genes in proximity to the shifted breakpoints is computed.</p>

Glucuronidase beta (<em>GUSB</em> [MIM: 611499]) was used as a housekeeping control. qPCR experiments were performed by the Harvard Biopolymers Facility using TaqMan probes Hs00264887_s1 (<em>POU3F4</em>), Hs00201978_m1 (<em>MID2</em>), Hs00176828_m1 (<em>PAK3</em>), Hs00893134_m1 (<em>SOS1</em>), and Hs00939627_m1 (<em>GUSB</em>).

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.1</span> Genomic characterization of non-coding breakpoints</h3>
<p>To study the structural and evolutionary context of BCAs and their impact on nuclear architecture and gene expression, we used data generated by DGAP,<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Lu2007"><strong>???</strong></span>; Higgins et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Higgins2008">2008</a>; Kim and Marcotte, <a href="references.html#ref-Kim2008">2008</a>; Ligon et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Ligon2005">2005</a>)</span> the largest collection of sequenced balanced chromosome rearrangements from individuals with abnormal developmental and cognitive phenotypes, many of which have yet to be investigated in detail. Each studied DGAP BCA has two breakpoint positions (as two distinct chromosome regions are involved in their generation), which we labeled with the DGAP#_A and DGAP#_B identifiers. We filtered DGAP data to select cases <span id="_Hlk482353484" class="anchor"></span>with both breakpoints in non-coding regions only, and excluding lincRNAs and pseudogenes; a total of 17 cases fulfilled our criteria, 15 translocations and 2 inversions (Figure 1 and <span id="_Hlk482620254" class="anchor"></span>Table S1). These subjects are phenotypically distinct, and most of them presented with congenital developmental and neurological conditions not recognized as a known syndrome or genomic disorder (<span id="_Hlk482620291" class="anchor"></span>see clinical descriptions in Supplemental Note: Case Reports).</p>
<p>Further analysis revealed that BCA breakpoints were significantly depleted for overlapping annotated promoters or transcription factor (TF) binding sites (GAT TF p=0.0003, promoter p=0.0001, Table S2,3). Only one breakpoint (DGAP249_B) overlapped a ChromHMM enhancer in GM12878 cells (Table 1); the others had no overlap with annotated or predicted enhancers in the analyzed datasets, and this depletion was significant for VISTA (GAT p=0.0364) and Hi-ESC (GAT p=0.0036) but not for the annotated tissue and primary cell enhancers from Andersson <em>et al</em>., 2014<span class="citation">(Andersson et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Andersson2014">2014</a>)</span> (Table S4). Eight breakpoints overlapped cell-type specific DHS sites (Table 1 and Table S5); these corresponded to DGAP cases 017, 176, 249, 275, 288 and 322; of these, DGAP176 and DGAP275 overlapped DHS sites at both BCA breakpoint sites. In addition, three DGAP cases overlapped CTCF binding sites in H1-hESC (DGAP cases 111, 176, and 287) and none in GM12878 cells (Table 1 and Table S6). Except for two cases in H1-hESC (DGAP17 and DGAP176), and four cases in GM12878 (DGAP 017, 126, 163 and 176), all rearrangements fall within ChromHMM repressed chromatin regions, but this association was not significant (GAT p= 0.40 for GM12878 and p= 0.15 for H1-hESC, Table S2F). Interestingly, 22 of the 34 breakpoints (~65%) overlap repeated elements at a significant level (GAT p=0.0002, Table S8), which may indicate a non-allelic homologous recombination process in their generation.<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Gu2008"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-no-output"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
<p>Noticeably, either one or two breakpoints from all the non-coding DGAP BCAs fall within previously reported TADs in H1-hESC and IMR90 cell lines (Table 1 and Table S9).<span class="citation">(Dixon et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Dixon2012">2012</a>)</span> However, this overlap was not significant for both cell lines (GAT H1-ESC p=0.0537 and IMR90 p=0.28). We <span id="_Hlk482608106" class="anchor"></span>found that the breakpoints disrupt dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of chromatin contacts when assessed at the 20 and 40 Kb resolution in Hi-C data of H1-hESC and IMR90 cells, as well as chromatin contacts at 100 Kb and 1 Mb resolution in GM06990 cells (Table S11). Breakpoint DGAP111_A had a consistent absence of disrupted chromatin contacts, which is expected as it overlaps a repetitive satellite region so no chromatin contacts could be mapped to the segment (Table S9 and Table S11). With the availability of higher resolution data, it is possible to detect whether BCA breakpoints disrupt smaller chromatin domains and loops not detected in previous studies. When analyzing <span id="_Hlk482358811" class="anchor"></span>high resolution IMR90 and GM12878 Hi-C data,<span class="citation">(Rao et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Rao2014">2014</a>)</span> we discovered that 32 out of 34 breakpoints are contained within GM12878 sub-compartments (Table 1 and Table S10); interestingly, 28 of these are classified as members of the B compartment, which is less gene dense and less expressed compared to the A compartment. On the other hand, 18 and 24 breakpoints are contained within GM12878 and IMR90 arrowhead domains, respectively (Table S10), which are regions of enhanced contact frequency that tile the diagonal of each chromatin contact matrix. In addition, the breakpoints disrupt several significant <span id="_Hlk482608863" class="anchor"></span>short and long-range chromatin interactions in the GM12878 Hi-C data (Table S12).</p>
<p>Overall, the observation of breakpoint-associated DHS sites suggests the alteration of underlying regulatory elements with potential pathogenic outcomes, while the predicted extensive disruption of chromatin contacts and the alteration of TAD boundaries by the BCAs may affect long-range regulatory interactions of neighboring genes (see Discussion).</p>

<div id="identification-of-genes-with-potential-position-effects" class="section level3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Identification of genes with potential position effects</h3>
<p>To identify genes which could be generating the complex DGAP phenotypes via position effects from chromosome rearrangements, we analyzed all annotated genes within windows of ±3 and ±1 Mb proximal and distal to the breakpoints, and within the BCA-containing H1-hESC reported TAD positions. A total of 3081 genes were contained within the ±3 and ±1 Mb windows for all cases; 106 of these genes (~3.4%) have an HI score of &lt;10%, which is a predictor of haploinsufficiency,<span class="citation">(Huang et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Huang2010">2010</a>)</span> and 55 and two genes have ClinGen emerging evidence suggesting that dosage haplo/triplo-sensitivity, respectively, is associated with clinical phenotype (Table S15).</p>
<p><span id="_mi37vs9hq9rp" class="anchor"></span> To further refine our search for genes which may exhibit position effects, we performed an unbiased correlation between DGAP case phenotypes and the clinical traits associated with genes bordering each breakpoint. To this end, we used the HPO dataset,<span class="citation">(Köhler et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Kohler2014">2014</a>)</span> which provides a standardized vocabulary of phenotypic abnormalities encountered in human disease, and currently contains ~11,000 terms and over 115,000 annotations to hereditary diseases. We <span id="_Hlk482610868" class="anchor"></span>translated DGAP clinical features to HPO terms (Table S16), and calculated phenotype similarity between DGAP cases and neighboring genes using the phenomatch score.<span class="citation">(Ibn-Salem et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Ibn-Salem2014">2014</a>)</span> The phenomatch score distinguishes between general and very specific phenotypic descriptions by quantifying the information content of the most speciﬁc HPO terms that are common to, or a common ancestor of, the DGAP case and neighboring gene phenotypes. The similarity significance is then calculated based on randomly permuting the associations of phenotypes to genes, and in shifting the DGAP translocation and inversion breakpoint positions along the chromosome. We obtained phenomatch scores ranging from 0.003 to 91.48 for 179 genes within the ±3 and ±1 Mb windows, <span id="_Hlk482620945" class="anchor"></span>as well as within the TAD positions (Table S15).</p>
<p>In addition to dosage sensitivity and phenotypic similarity information, we complemented our analysis with assessment of enhancer-promoter interactions to make our candidate selection more specific. A typical mechanism by which chromosome rearrangements cause position effects is through disruptions in the association of genes with their regulatory regions.<span class="citation">(Kleinjan and Heyningen, <a href="references.html#ref-Kleinjan1998">1998</a>; Kleinjan and Van Heyningen, <a href="references.html#ref-Kleinjan2005">2005</a>)</span> We therefore reasoned that genes and enhancers included in predicted enhancer-promoter interactions would be strong position effect candidates. We used the <span id="_Hlk482609237" class="anchor"></span>ENCODE distal DHS/enhancer–promoter connections<span class="citation">(Thurman et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Thurman2012">2012</a>)</span> to assess disrupted predicted <em>cis</em>-regulatory interactions by the DGAP breakpoints within a ±500 Kb window. The analysis revealed 193 genes that were separated from their predicted candidate enhancers, potentially altering gene expression (Table S13). A <span id="_Hlk482609962" class="anchor"></span>total of 133 candidate genes were separated from &lt;10 of their predicted enhancers, while 60 genes were separated from their predicted interactions with 10 or up to 91 enhancers (Table S14).</p>
<p>For the 17 analyzed DGAP BCAs, there are a total of 645 genes with either evidence of dosage sensitivity, disrupted enhancer-promoter interactions, or significant phenotypic similarity. This represents ~21% of the genes contained within the ±3 Mb windows, clearly an undesirable number for timely clinical interpretation and functional analyses. To filter the most promising candidates, we ranked them using their reported dosage sensitivity, disrupted regulatory interactions, and by selecting a phenomatch cut-off value capable of detecting pathogenic and likely pathogenic genes in 57 published DGAP cases from Redin <em>et al</em>., 2017.<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Redin2017"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> By taking into consideration the top quartile values of the reported phenomatch scores per case and adding up their dosage sensitivity and disrupted regulatory interaction data, we consistently ranked the reported pathogenic and likely pathogenic genes in the upper decile for 52 out of the 57 control DGAP cases (~91%) when considering candidates within the TAD and ±1 Mb analysis windows (Table S17). 32 of these genes were the top-ranking candidates in their corresponding DGAP case, while 19 of them were positioned in the second-tier rank. Only five genes could not be found in the top decile ranking positions as they had one or no lines of evidence supporting their inclusion.</p>
<p>Applying this ranking strategy to the 17 non-coding BCAs, we predict 16 top-ranking candidates for 11 DGAP cases and 102 second-tier candidates for the 17 analyzed DGAP cases within ±1 Mb analysis windows (Table 1 and Table S15). This is a significant reduction compared to the initial 645 possible candidates (~3.8% of the neighboring genes in the ±3 Mb windows considering top and second-tier candidates, and only 0.05% considering top candidates only). Of note, only nine of the 16 top-ranking candidates are included within the same TAD as the BCA breakpoint (H1-hESC TADs from <span class="citation">(Dixon et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Dixon2012">2012</a>)</span>), while the rest are located farther away. Nine top-ranking genes had an HI score &lt;10%,<span class="citation">(Huang et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Huang2010">2010</a>)</span> while ClinGen HI data revealed that four of these 16 genes are associated with autosomal recessive phenotypes, and an additional seven have sufficient or some evidence for haploinsufficiency. Only one candidate gene for DGAP138, glutamate ionotropic receptor kainate type subunit 2 (<em>GRIK2</em> [MIM: 138244]) was a confirmed triplosensitive annotated gene in ClinGen (Table S15).</p>
<p>Taken together, these cases represent more plausible candidates in the search for position effect genes with functional consequences in the subjects’ phenotypes.<span id="_1momymjcrc1t" class="anchor"></span> Examples include <em>GRIK2</em> which could explain the intellectual disability observed in DGAP138; <em>SOS1</em>, forkhead box G1 (<em>FOXG1</em> [MIM: 164874]) and cochlin (<em>COCH</em> [MIM: 603196]) may be related to the neurological and developmental delay as well as hearing loss of DGAP163; acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (<em>ACSL4</em> [MIM: 300157]) and <em>POU3F4</em> could be involved in DGAP176’s cognitive impairment and hearing loss; SATB homeobox 2 (<em>SATB2</em> [MIM: 608148]) may underlie the delayed speech and language development observed in DGAP249; RB binding protein 8 endonuclease (<em>RBBP8</em> [MIM: 604124]) may be involved in DGAP252’s craniofacial dysmorphic features; <em>SOX9</em> most likely explains the cleft palate observed in DGAP288; DNA polymerase epsilon catalytic subunit (<em>POLE</em> [MIM: 174762]) may contribute to the extreme short stature observed in DGAP275, and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2 (<em>ZEB2</em> [MIM: 605802]) can potentially explain the hypotonia and neurological features observed in DGAP329. <em>SOX9</em> had been previously proposed to explain DGAP288’s phenotype, and as predicted by our method, a decrease in its expression was observed in RNA derived from DGAP288’s umbilical cord blood.<span class="citation">(Ordulu et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Ordulu2016">2016</a>)</span> Additional quantitative real-time PCR analyses revealed <em>SOS1</em> as having reduced expression in DGAP163-derived LCLs compared to three normal sex-matched controls (Figure 2).Expression assessment for second-tier candidates <em>PAK3</em>, <em>MID2</em> and <em>POU3F4</em> in DGAP176 LCLs did not deviate substantially from their control expression values (Figure S1); further searches into the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Consortium2013"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> reveal that <em>PAK3</em>, <em>MID2</em> and <em>POU3F4</em> have low expression in LCLs, which would have made assessing changes in expression of these genes technically difficult. This points to the importance of the availability of tissues and cell lines relevant to the studied phenotypes, or the capacity to generate animal models that reproduce the observed BCAs for further analysis.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.3</span> Identification of subjects with shared non-coding chromosome alterations and phenotypes</h3>
<p>The identification of subjects with shared non-coding chromosome alterations and phenotypes as described herein would further support our idea of these rearrangements exerting their pathogenic outcomes through long-range position effects. To identify such subjects, we searched the DECIPHER<span class="citation">(Firth et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Firth2009">2009</a>)</span> and dbVar databases,<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Lappalainen2013"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> both comprehensive community-supported repositories of clinical cases with novel or extremely rare genomic variants.</p>
<p>We found 494 <span id="_Hlk482612787" class="anchor"></span>DECIPHER cases overlapping our 34 non-coding BCA breakpoints (Table S19). Of these, 489 had rearrangements that overlapped one or more annotated genes (Table S20). Only five DECIPHER cases fulfilled our non-coding selection criteria (Table S21): cases 1985 and 1989, both of which overlap one of DGAP017’s breakpoints in chromosome 10, but which have several other gene-altering genomic rearrangements; case 289720, a subject with a 161.44 Kb deletion in chromosome 10 described as likely benign and sharing a sequence breakpoint with DGAP126; case 289865 overlapping a breakpoint in DGAP126 in chromosome 10, very similar to case 289720, however with the presence of an additional pathogenic gene-altering rearrangement; and lastly case 293610, a pathogenic duplication of 364.43 Kb in chromosome 17 sharing a breakpoint with DGAP288. <span id="_Hlk482621666" class="anchor"></span>Only two of the five DECIPHER cases have reported clinical phenotypes. DECIPHER case 289720 presents with intellectual disability and psychosis, both pertaining to the superclasses of behavioral and neurodevelopmental abnormalities under the HPO classification. <span id="_Hlk482621758" class="anchor"></span>Interestingly, DGAP126 has abnormal aggressive, impulsive or violent behavior and auto-aggression, as well as language and motor delays, which also fall under the classification of behavioral and neurodevelopmental abnormalities. DECIPHER case 293610 has reported gonadal tissue discordant for external genitalia or chromosomal sex as well as a non-obstructive azoospermia clinical phenotype;<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Vetro2015"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> both features are not observed until puberty, and are associated with the female-to-male sex disorder observed for CNVs altering the <em>SOX9</em> genomic landscape. Although DGAP288 is still an infant, there is no report of sex reversal.</p>
<p>From the dbVar database, 675 non-coding structural rearrangements including CNVs, deletions, inversions, and translocations overlap DGAP breakpoints (Table S22). Of these, only five variants had associated clinical information, including variant nsv534336, a 530 Kb duplication overlapping the DGAP017 breakpoint in chromosome 10, classified as “uncertain significance”<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Miller2010"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> and exhibiting a growth delay phenotype; nsv931775, a benign ~381.8 Kb deletion overlapping the DGAP113 breakpoint on chromosome 3, associated with developmental delay and/or other significant developmental or morphological phenotypes;<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Miller2010"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span> nsv534571, an ~639.7 Kb duplication of uncertain significance associated with muscular hypotonia and overlapping the DGAP287 breakpoint on chromosome 10; and variants nsv532026 and nsv917014, two duplications of ~613 Kb classified as “uncertain significance” and “likely benign,” respectively, overlapping the DGAP315 breakpoint in chromosome 6, and associated with developmental delay and/or other significant developmental or morphological phenotypes as well as autism and global developmental delay. All the detected variants are associated with phenotypes observed in the DGAP cases, especially DGAP017’s hypoplasia, the developmental delay observed in DGAP113, and DGAP315’s significant developmental or morphological phenotypes.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, these phenotypes are disparate, but fall under similar phenotypic categories, which could enable identification of long-range effect genes between different cases <span id="_Hlk482621878" class="anchor"></span>with similar clinical features and chromosome rearrangements. These comparisons highlight the importance of establishing detailed, specific, and unbiased guidelines for assigning phenotypes when performing computational phenotype comparisons.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.5</span> Discussion</h2>
<p>Structural variation of the human genome, either inherited or arising by <em>de novo</em> germline or somatic mutations, can give rise to different phenotypes through several mechanisms. Chromosome rearrangements can alter gene dosage, promote gene fusions, unmask recessive alleles, or disrupt associations between genes and their regulatory elements. The traditional clinical focus of studying genes disrupted by chromosome rearrangements has shifted to also assess regions neighboring these variants.<span class="citation">(Ordulu et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Ordulu2016">2016</a>)</span> This search for positional effects has been particularly important in the analysis of chromosome rearrangements associated with different clinical conditions and disrupting non-annotated genomic regions.<span class="citation">(Spielmann and Mundlos, <a href="references.html#ref-Spielmann2016">2016</a>; Zhang and Wolynes, <a href="references.html#ref-Zhang2015">2015</a>)</span></p>
<p>The study of chromatin conformation has been requisite in the analysis of such non-coding rearrangements. DNA is organized in the three-dimensional nucleus at varying hierarchical levels that are important for the regulation of gene expression,<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="de"><strong>???</strong></span> Wit2012)</span> with primary roles in embryonic development and disease.<span class="citation">(Bonev and Cavalli, <a href="references.html#ref-Bonev2016">2016</a>)</span> Several studies have analyzed the impact of structural variants in disruption of the regulatory chromatin environment leading to disease;<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Groschel2014"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-no-output"><strong>???</strong></span>; Ibn-Salem et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Ibn-Salem2014">2014</a>; Lupiáñez et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Lupianez2015">2015</a>; Visser et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Visser2012">2012</a>)</span> these studies have set the precedent for integrative analyses of disrupted chromatin conformation to expedite functional annotations of non-coding chromosome rearrangements.</p>
<p>We tested the possibility of utilizing chromatin contact information to dissect chromosome rearrangements which disrupt non-coding chromosome regions in clinical cases. We focused on 17 subjects from DGAP, 12 with available clinical microarray information, with different rare presentations and <em>de novo</em> non-coding BCAs classified as VUS. Of these, 15 corresponded to translocations and two were inversions. These cases represent ~11% of the total number of sequenced DGAP cases, which makes our predictions even more significant for future potential treatment or management of subjects who would not otherwise obtain a clinical diagnosis. Utilizing publicly available annotated genomic and regulatory elements, chromatin conformation capture information, predicted enhancer-promoter interactions, phenomatch scores, as well as haploinsufficiency and triplosensitivity information for all genes surrounding the BCA breakpoints at different window sizes (±3 and ±1 Mb as well as BCA-containing TAD positions), we discovered 16 genes for 11 DGAP cases that are top-ranking position effect candidates for the subjects’ clinical phenotypes (Table 1).</p>
<p>We observed that eight of the sequenced DGAP BCA breakpoints, corresponding to six DGAP cases (DGAP017, 176, 249, 275, 288 and 322), overlapped reported annotated and predicted enhancers and DHS sites. <span id="_Hlk482705599" class="anchor"></span>Disruption of these regulatory elements could potentially cause improper gene expression or repression through altered enhancer-promoter interactions or interactions with other DHS-associated elements such as insulators and locus control regions, among others. <span id="_Hlk482611220" class="anchor"></span>In fact, four of the breakpoints that disrupt annotated DHS sites and enhancers have been shown to establish chromatin contacts with our top position effect candidate genes in the region in Hi-C data of H1-hESC cells at 40 Kb resolution (Table S18). For example, the DGAP275_B breakpoint is involved in a chromatin interaction that puts it into physical proximity with <em>POLE</em> and <em>ANKLE2,</em> DGAP288_B contacts <em>SOX9</em>, and DGAP176_B interacts with <em>ACSL4</em>. Three additional breakpoints from DGAP111, 249 and 287 overlap CTCF binding sites. CTCF binding sites are enriched in TAD boundaries,<span class="citation">(Dixon et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Dixon2012">2012</a>)</span> and the elimination of these binding sites could potentially induce gene expression or other functional changes through alteration of the structural regulatory landscape of the region.<span class="citation">(Lupiáñez et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Lupianez2015">2015</a>)</span></p>
<p>There are nine DGAP cases (DGAP113, 126, 138, 153, 163, 252, 315, 319 and 329), six with normal arrays and two with benign CNVs, for which no overlap with genomic or other regulatory elements was detected. These cases thus represent events in which position effects are most likely caused by alteration of the underlying chromatin structure itself. This hypothesis is supported by detection of a vast number of disrupted chromatin contacts in four different cell lines (H1-hESC, IMR90, GM06990, GM12878) at different Hi-C window resolutions, 32 breakpoints included in H1-hESC TADs,<span class="citation">(Dixon et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Dixon2012">2012</a>)</span> and the separation of 193 genes from one and up to 91 of their predicted enhancers after the occurrence of the BCAs (Table S14). For example, <em>SOS1</em>, one of the most significant candidates in explaining DGAP163’s global developmental delay, dysmorphic/distinctive facies and hearing loss, as observed in <span id="_Hlk482622030" class="anchor"></span>Noonan Syndrome 1 (NS1 [MIM: 163950]), is separated from its interaction with 88 predicted enhancers (Figure 3), and exhibited a decrease in expression in DGAP163-derived LCLs. However, NS1 is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in <em>SOS1</em>; we hypothesize that the reduced expression of <em>SOS1</em> might affect the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and generate clinical features not completely overlapping those of NS1; however, this possibility remains to be functionally tested and complimented with analyses of genomic single nucleotide variants. A similar approach could be explored for DGAP275, where we hypothesize that <em>POLE</em>, associated with <span id="_Hlk482622104" class="anchor"></span>the facial dysmorphism, immunodeficiency, livedo, and short stature syndrome (FILS [MIM: 615139]) in an autosomal recessive manner,<span class="citation">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="Pachlopnik"><strong>???</strong></span> Schmid2012)</span> may contribute to the extreme short stature observed in this DGAP subject; and <em>ZEB2</em>, etiologic for <span id="_Hlk482622233" class="anchor"></span>Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MOWS [MIM: 235730]) in an autosomal dominant manner (OMIM#235730), may potentially explain the hypotonia and neurological features observed in DGAP329 but not present all of the dysmorphic features or medical/non-neurologic phenotype of MOWS. Overall, more candidate genes will need to be analyzed rigorously to assess the validity of our position effect predictions and the disruption of important chromatin regulatory elements. Nonetheless, insight into the molecular pathway of disorders may be forthcoming from our approach and of value in the management of some individuals.</p>
<p>All predicted candidate genes have different lines of evidence supporting their selection, starting with a significant phenomatch score that correlates annotated gene phenotypes to those observed in the DGAP cases. HI and triplosensitivity evidence, inclusion in TAD regions, as well as HI scores build upon this selection, and can help laboratories and clinicians focus in subsequent analyses on candidates of their interest. As of now, the “top-ranking” candidates have the highest number of evidence supporting their selection; however, there are also 102 second-tier candidates for the 17 analyzed DGAP cases within ±1 Mb analysis windows which may well play a functional role. Presently, we are unable to give “weights” to any of these selection criteria (<em>i.e</em>., a gene with a high phenomatch score and no evidence of HI is “more significant” than a gene with a medium phenomatch score and evidence of HI) mainly for two reasons: (i) we would need to collect more examples, which might not be easy to find and require a tremendous curation effort, and (ii) we need to understand the possibility, suggested by our results, that more than one gene may be contributory in the clinical presentation of the DGAP subjects, either acting simultaneously or throughout development. Moreover, many of the candidates have recessive inheritance modes, which make it necessary to assess the mutational status of both alleles as well as additional sequence variants not captured by our BCA breakpoint sequencing and the microarrays. Future in-depth exome, DNA and RNA sequencing as well as Hi-C experiments will provide a comprehensive view of the contribution of sequence variants, disruption of chromatin contacts, and changes in gene expression in the DGAP disease etiologies, such that guidelines might be developed as to which candidates should be followed up first and further studied with comprehensive functional validation using animal models and human cell lines that reproduce the BCA breakpoints.</p>
<p>Overall our results suggest that the integration of phenomatch scores, altered chromatin contacts, and other clinical gene annotations provide valuable interpretation to many variants of uncertain significance through long-range position effects. The correct prediction of 52 out of 57 known pathogenic genes in DGAP cases used as positive controls supports such integration. Our computational analysis is rapid and can provide additional information to benefit the clinical assessment of both coding and non-coding genome variants. The latter is an important step towards prediction of pathogenic consequences of non-coding variantion observed in prenatal samples. For example, based on its position and chromatin contact alterations, we correctly predicted the involvement and decreased expression of <em>SOX9</em> in the cleft palate Pierre-Robin sequence (PRBNS [MIM: 261800]) association in DGAP288.<span class="citation">(Ordulu et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Ordulu2016">2016</a>)</span></p>
<p>Lastly, we would like to note that predicting the pathogenic outcome of disrupted chromatin contacts is not a straightforward endeavor: it has been shown that a single gene promoter can be targeted by several enhancers,<span class="citation">(Thurman et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Thurman2012">2012</a>)</span> therefore compensating for the perturbed interactions by the chromosome rearrangements. <span id="_Hlk482704398" class="anchor"></span>In addition, rearrangements can reposition gene promoters and enhancers outside of their preferred chromatin environments, leading to improper gene activation by enhancer adoption.<span class="citation">(Lupiáñez et al., <a href="references.html#ref-Lupianez2015">2015</a>)</span> <span id="_Hlk482704355" class="anchor"></span>Our method currently identifies instances in which known and predicted enhancer/promoter interactions are disrupted by the rearrangement breakpoints and thus lead to decreased candidate gene expression. Enhancer adoption prediction will be incorporated once mathematical models of TAD formation upon changes in genomic sequence are refined and available to the greater scientific community. Presently, our predictions are as good as the availability of pathogenic gene annotations, chromatin conformation data, clinical phenotype information, and the presence of similar rearrangements in databases such as DECIPHER and dbVar. While the existence of other subjects with related phenotypes to the DGAP cases does not prove the involvement of neighboring genes in the etiology of these phenotypes, it is a step forward towards prediction of pathogenic effects starting from a simple computational analysis, pointing to a better phenotypic categorization when clinically examining affected individuals. <span id="_Hlk482622863" class="anchor"></span>By making our position effect prediction method available to the human genetics community, we hope to study additional cases with complete phenotypic information and be able to refine better the rules for the prediction of position effects on gene expression and discover new mechanisms of pathogenicity.</p>
