**(A)** Number of paralog (red) and sampled (grey) gene pairs that are in the same TAD or not separated in three groups of genomic distances (0-10kb, 10-1000kb and $>$ 1000kb). TADs called from IMR90 cells by [@Rao2014] were used here.

The eighth bar shows the value for stable TADs across cell types form this study (at least 90\% reciprocal overlap in 50\% of cells). The last two bars show data for TADs called in hESC and IMR90 cells by [@Dixon2012]. Error bars indicate standard deviation in 10 times replicated sampling of gene pairs. P-values are computed using Fisher's exact test.
