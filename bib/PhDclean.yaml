  annote: Protein complex topology model of Cohesin and CTCF on DNA at loop anchors
  abstract: ChIP-seq provides a wealth of information on the approximate location
    of DNA-binding proteins genome-wide. It is known that the targeted motifs in most
    cases can be found at the peak centers. A high resolution mapping of ChIP-seq
    peaks could in principle allow the fine mapping of the protein constituents within
    protein complexes, but the current ChIP-seq analysis pipelines do not target the
    basepair resolution strand specific mapping of peak summits. The approach proposed
    here is based on i) locating regions that are bound by a sufficient number of
    proteins constituting a complex; ii) determining the position of the underlying
    motif using either a direct or a de novo motif search approach; and iii) determining
    the exact location of the peak summits with respect to the binding motif in a
    strand specific manner. We applied this method for analyzing the CTCF/cohesin
    complex, which holds together DNA loops. The relative positions of the constituents
    of the complex were determined with one-basepair estimated accuracy. Mapping the
    positions on a 3D model of DNA made it possible to deduce the approximate local
    topology of the complex that allowed us to predict how the CTCF/cohesin complex
    locks the DNA loops. As the positioning of the proteins was not compatible with
    previous models of loop closure, we proposed a plausible “double embrace” model
    in which the DNA loop is held together by two adjacent cohesin rings in such a
    way that the ring anchored by CTCF to one DNA duplex encircles the other DNA double
    helix and vice versa. A motif-centered, strand specific analysis of ChIP-seq data
    improves the accuracy of determining peak positions. If a genome contains a large
    number of binding sites for a given protein complex, such as transcription factor
    heterodimers or transcription factor/cofactor complexes, the relative position
    of the constituent proteins on the DNA can be established with an accuracy that
    allow one to deduce the local topology of the protein complex. The proposed high
    resolution mapping approach of ChIP-seq data is applicable for detecting the contact
    topology of DNA-binding protein complexes.

  title: Gene family level comparative analysis of gene expression n mammals validates
    the ortholog conjecture
  container-title: Genome Biology and Evolution
  page: '754-762'
  volume: '6'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The ortholog conjecture (OC), which is central to functional annotation
    of genomes, posits that orthologous genes are functionally more similar than paralogous
    genes at the same level of sequence divergence. However, a recent study challenged
    the OC by reporting a greater functional similarity, in terms of Gene Ontology
    (GO) annotations and expression profiles, among within-species paralogs compared
    with orthologs. These findings were taken to indicate that functional similarity
    of homologous genes is primarily determined by the cellular context of the genes,
    rather than evolutionary history. However, several subsequent studies suggest
    that GO annotations and microarray data could artificially inflate functional
    similarity between paralogs from the same organism. We sought to test the OC using
    approaches distinct from those used in previous studies. Analysis of a large RNAseq
    data set from multiple human and mouse tissues shows that expression similarity
    (correlations coefficients, rank’s, or Z-scores) between orthologs is substantially
    greater than that for between-species paralogs with the same sequence divergence,
    in agreement with the OC and the results of recent detailed analyses. These findings
    are further corroborated by a fine-grain analysis in which expression profiles
    of orthologs and paralogs were compared separately for individual gene families.
    Expression profiles of within-species paralogs are more strongly correlated than
    profiles of orthologs but it is shown that this is caused by high background noise,
    that is, correlation between profiles of unrelated genes in the same organism.
    Z-scores and rank scores show a nonmonotonic dependence of expression profile
    similarity on sequence divergence. This complexity of gene expression evolution
    after duplication might be at least partially caused by selection for protein
    dosage rebalancing following gene duplication.

  title: Age-dependent evolution of the yeast protein interaction network suggests
    a limited role of gene duplication and divergence.
  container-title: PLoS computational biology
  page: 'e1000232'
  volume: '4'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: Proteins interact in complex protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks
    whose topological properties-such as scale-free topology, hierarchical modularity,
    and dissortativity-have suggested models of network evolution. Currently preferred
    models invoke preferential attachment or gene duplication and divergence to produce
    networks whose topology matches that observed for real PPIs, thus supporting these
    as likely models for network evolution. Here, we show that the interaction density
    and homodimeric frequency are highly protein age-dependent in real PPI networks
    in a manner which does not agree with these canonical models. In light of these
    results, we propose an alternative stochastic model, which adds each protein sequentially
    to a growing network in a manner analogous to protein crystal growth (CG) in solution.
    The key ideas are (1) interaction probability increases with availability of unoccupied
    interaction surface, thus following an anti-preferential attachment rule, (2)
    as a network grows, highly connected sub-networks emerge into protein modules
    or complexes, and (3) once a new protein is committed to a module, further connections
    tend to be localized within that module. The CG model produces PPI networks consistent
    in both topology and age distributions with real PPI networks and is well supported
    by the spatial arrangement of protein complexes of known 3-D structure, suggesting
    a plausible physical mechanism for network evolution.

  page: '456-464'
  volume: '17'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Cellular phenotypes can critically rely on mono-allelic gene expression.
    Recent studies suggest that in mammalian cells inter-chromosomal DNA interactions
    may mediate the decision which allele to activate and which to silence. Here,
    these findings are discussed in the context of knowledge on gene competition,
    chromatin dynamics, and nuclear organization. We argue that data obtained by 4C
    technology strongly support the idea that chromatin folds according to self-organizing
    principles. In this concept, the nuclear positioning of a given locus is probabilistic
    as it also depends on the properties of neighbouring DNA segments and, by extrapolation,
    the whole chromosome. The linear distribution of repetitive DNA sequences and
    of active and inactive DNA regions is important for the folding and relative positioning
    of chromosomes. This stochastic concept of nuclear organization predicts that
    tissue-specific interactions between two selected loci present on different chromosomes
    will be rare.

  container-title: Cell
  publisher: Cell Press
  page: '1231-1245'
  volume: '128'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: Insulator elements affect gene expression by preventing the spread of
    heterochromatin and restricting transcriptional enhancers from activation of unrelated
    promoters. In vertebrates, insulator’s function requires association with the
    CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF), a protein that recognizes long and diverse nucleotide
    sequences. While insulators are critical in gene regulation, only a few have been
    reported. Here, we describe 13,804 CTCF-binding sites in potential insulators
    of the human genome, discovered experimentally in primary human fibroblasts. Most
    of these sequences are located far from the transcriptional start sites, with
    their distribution strongly correlated with genes. The majority of them fit to
    a consensus motif highly conserved and suitable for predicting possible insulators
    driven by CTCF in other vertebrate genomes. In addition, CTCF localization is
    largely invariant across different cell types. Our results provide a resource
    for investigating insulator function and possible other general and evolutionarily
    conserved activities of CTCF sites.

  title: Position Effects Due to Chromosome Breakpoints that Map ∼900 Kb Upstream
    and ∼1.3 Mb Downstream of SOX9 in Two Patients with Campomelic Dysplasia
  container-title: The American Journal of Human Genetics
  publisher: Cell Press
  page: '652-662'
  volume: '76'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Campomelic dysplasia (CD) is a semilethal skeletal malformation syndrome
    with or without XY sex reversal. In addition to the multiple mutations found within
    the sex-determining region Y–related high-mobility group box gene (SOX9) on 17q24.3,
    several chromosome anomalies (translocations, inversions, and deletions) with
    breakpoints scattered over 1 Mb upstream of SOX9 have been described. Here, we
    present a balanced translocation, t(4;17)(q28.3;q24.3), segregating in a family
    with a mild acampomelic CD with Robin sequence. Both chromosome breakpoints have
    been identified by fluorescence in situ hybridization and have been sequenced
    using a somatic cell hybrid. The 17q24.3 breakpoint maps ∼900 kb upstream of SOX9,
    which is within the same bacterial artificial chromosome clone as the breakpoints
    of two other reported patients with mild CD. We also report a prenatal identification
    of acampomelic CD with male-to-female sex reversal in a fetus with a de novo balanced
    complex karyotype, 46,XY,t(4;7;8;17)(4qter→4p15.1::17q25.1→17qter;7qter→7p15.3::4p15.1→4pter;8pter→8q12.1::7p15.3→7pter;17pter→17q25.1::8q12.1→8qter).
    Surprisingly, the 17q breakpoint maps ∼1.3 Mb downstream of SOX9, making this
    the longest-range position effect found in the field of human genetics and the
    first report of a patient with CD with the chromosome breakpoint mapping 3′ of
    SOX9. By using the Regulatory Potential score in conjunction with analysis of
    the rearrangement breakpoints, we identified a candidate upstream cis-regulatory
    element, SOX9cre1. We provide evidence that this 1.1-kb evolutionarily conserved
    element and the downstream breakpoint region colocalize with SOX9 in the interphase
    nucleus, despite being located 1.1 Mb upstream and 1.3 Mb downstream of it, respectively.
    The potential molecular mechanism responsible for the position effect is discussed.

  annote: \- 4C at CTCF binding sites - delete CTCF sites by CRISPR/Cas9
  abstract: CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF) is an architectural protein involved in the
    three-dimensional (3D) organization of chromatin. In this study, we assayed the
    3D genomic contact profiles of a large number of CTCF binding sites with high-resolution
    4C-seq. As recently reported, our data also suggest that chromatin loops preferentially
    form between CTCF binding sites oriented in a convergent manner. To directly test
    this, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to delete core CTCF binding sites in
    three loci, including the CTCF site in the Sox2 super-enhancer. In all instances,
    CTCF and cohesin recruitment were lost, and chromatin loops with distal, convergent
    CTCF sites were disrupted or destabilized. Re-insertion of oppositely oriented
    CTCF recognition sequences restored CTCF and cohesin recruitment, but did not
    re-establish chromatin loops. We conclude that CTCF binding polarity plays a functional
    role in the formation of higher-order chromatin structure.

  title: Recurring genomic breaks in independent lineages support genomic fragility.
  container-title: BMC evolutionary biology
  page: '90'
  volume: '6'
  abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Recent findings indicate that evolutionary breaks in the
    genome are not randomly distributed, and that certain regions, so-called fragile
    regions, are predisposed to breakages. Previous approaches to the study of genomic
    fragility have examined the distribution of breaks, as well as the coincidence
    of breaks with segmental duplications and repeats, within a single species. In
    contrast, we investigate whether this regional fragility is an inherent genomic
    characteristic and is thus conserved over multiple independent lineages. RESULTS:
    We do this by quantifying the extent to which certain genomic regions are disrupted
    repeatedly in independent lineages. Our investigation, based on Human, Chimp,
    Mouse, Rat, Dog and Chicken, suggests that the propensity of a chromosomal region
    to break is significantly correlated among independent lineages, even when covariates
    are considered. Furthermore, the fragile regions are enriched for segmental duplications.
    CONCLUSION: Based on a novel methodology, our work provides additional support
    for the existence of fragile regions.'

  abstract: During the last quarter of the twentieth century, our knowledge about
    human genetic variation was limited mainly to the heterochromatin polymorphisms,
    large enough to be visible in the light microscope, and the single nucleotide
    polymorphisms (SNPs) identified by traditional PCR-based DNA sequencing. In the
    past five years, the rapid development and expanded use of microarray technologies,
    including oligonucleotide array comparative genomic hybridization and SNP genotyping
    arrays, as well as next-generation sequencing with “paired-end” methods, has enabled
    a whole-genome analysis with essentially unlimited resolution. The discovery of
    submicroscopic copy-number variations (CNVs) present in our genomes has changed
    dramatically our perspective on DNA structural variation and disease. It is now
    thought that CNVs encompass more total nucleotides and arise more frequently than
    SNPs. CNVs, to a larger extent than SNPs, have been shown to be responsible for
    human evolution, genetic diversity between individuals,...

  abstract: Developmental programs are controlled by transcription factors and chromatin
    regulators, which maintain specific gene expression programs through epigenetic
    modification of the genome. These regulatory events at enhancers contribute to
    the specific gene expression programs that determine cell state and the potential
    for differentiation into new cell types. Although enhancer elements are known
    to be associated with certain histone modifications and transcription factors,
    the relationship of these modifications to gene expression and developmental state
    has not been clearly defined. Here we interrogate the epigenetic landscape of
    enhancer elements in embryonic stem cells and several adult tissues in the mouse.
    We find that histone H3K27ac distinguishes active enhancers from inactive/poised
    enhancer elements containing H3K4me1 alone. This indicates that the amount of
    actively used enhancers is lower than previously anticipated. Furthermore, poised
    enhancer networks provide clues to unrealized developmental programs. Finally,
    we show that enhancers are reset during nuclear reprogramming.

  issue: '5683'
  abstract: The extent to which large duplications and deletions contribute to human
    genetic variation and diversity is unknown. Here, we show that large-scale copy
    number polymorphisms (CNPs) (about 100 kilobases and greater) contribute substantially
    to genomic variation between normal humans. Representational oligonucleotide microarray
    analysis of 20 individuals revealed a total of 221 copy number differences representing
    76 unique CNPs. On average, individuals differed by 11 CNPs, and the average length
    of a CNP interval was 465 kilobases. We observed copy number variation of 70 different
    genes within CNP intervals, including genes involved in neurological function,
    regulation of cell growth, regulation of metabolism, and several genes known to
    be associated with disease.

  title: Heterochromatin and gene expression in Drosophila.
  container-title: Annual review of genetics
  page: '577-605'
  volume: '29'
  abstract: Heterochromatin is both necessary for the expression of heterochromatic
    genes and inhibitory for the expression of euchromatic genes. These two properties
    of heterochromatin have been elucidated from the study of chromosome rearrangements
    that induce position effect variegation (PEV) in Drosophila melanogaster. Novel
    euchromatin-heterochromatin junctions can affect the expression of euchromatic
    and heterochromatic genes located several megabases away, distinguishing higher
    order chromatin structure from most other regulatory mechanisms. Studies of PEV
    promise insights into the basis for heterochromatin formation and the role of
    higher order chromatin and chromosome structure in gene regulation. We evaluate
    the models and experimental data that address the mechanisms of PEV in different
    cell types, the potential functions of modifiers of PEV, and the relationship
    of PEV to other phenomena associated with variegated gene expression in Drosophila.

  abstract: Developmental progression is driven by specific spatiotemporal domains
    of gene expression, which give rise to stereotypically patterned embryos even
    in the presence of environmental and genetic variation. Views of how transcription
    factors regulate gene expression are changing owing to recent genome-wide studies
    of transcription factor binding and RNA expression. Such studies reveal patterns
    that, at first glance, seem to contrast with the robustness of the developmental
    processes they encode. Here, we review our current knowledge of transcription
    factor function from genomic and genetic studies and discuss how different strategies,
    including extensive cooperative regulation (both direct and indirect), progressive
    priming of regulatory elements, and the integration of activities from multiple
    enhancers, confer specificity and robustness to transcriptional regulation during
    development.

  annote: From Duplicate 1 (Enhancer-promoter interactions are encoded by complex
    genomic signatures on looping chromatin - Whalen, Sean; Truty, Rebecca M; Pollard,
    Katherine S)Computational method to predict enhancer-promoter associations
  abstract: Discriminating the gene target of a distal regulatory element from other
    nearby transcribed genes is a challenging problem with the potential to illuminate
    the causal underpinnings of complex diseases. We present TargetFinder, a computational
    method that reconstructs regulatory landscapes from diverse features along the
    genome. The resulting models accurately predict individual enhancer-promoter interactions
    across multiple cell lines with a false discovery rate up to 15 times smaller
    than that obtained using the closest gene. By evaluating the genomic features
    driving this accuracy, we uncover interactions between structural proteins, transcription
    factors, epigenetic modifications, and transcription that together distinguish
    interacting from non-interacting enhancer-promoter pairs. Most of this signature
    is not proximal to the enhancers and promoters but instead decorates the looping
    DNA. We conclude that complex but consistent combinations of marks on the one-dimensional
    genome encode the three-dimensional structure of fine-scale regulatory interactions.

  volume: '12'

  abstract: 'Background: In comparison with many nuclear proteins, the movement
    of chromatin in nuclei appears to be generally constrained. These restrictions
    on motion are proposed to reflect the attachment of chromatin to immobile nuclear
    substructures. Results: To gain insight into the regulation of chromosome dynamics
    by nuclear architecture, we have followed the movements of different sites in
    the human genome in living cells. Here, we show that loci at nucleoli or the nuclear
    periphery are significantly less mobile than other, more nucleoplasmic loci. Disruption
    of nucleoli increases the mobility of nucleolar-associated loci. Conclusions:
    This is the first report of distinct nuclear substructures constraining the movements
    of chromatin. These constraints reflect the physical attachment of chromatin to
    nuclear compartments or steric impairment caused by local ultrastructure. Our
    data suggest a role for the nucleolus and nuclear periphery in maintaining the
    three-dimensional organization of chromatin in the human nucleus.'

  annote: \- deletion of CTCF binding site at Hox cluster -\> result in expansion

    heterochromatin
  abstract: Polycomb and Trithorax group proteins encode the epigenetic memory of
    cellular positional identity by establishing inheritable domains of repressive
    and active chromatin within the Hox clusters. Here we demonstrate that the CCCTC-binding
    factor (CTCF) functions to insulate these adjacent yet antagonistic chromatin
    domains during embryonic stem cell differentiation into cervical motor neurons.
    Deletion of CTCF binding sites within the Hox clusters results in the expansion
    of active chromatin into the repressive domain. CTCF functions as an insulator
    by organizing Hox clusters into spatially disjoint domains. Ablation of CTCF binding
    disrupts topological boundaries such that caudal Hox genes leave the repressed
    domain and become subject to transcriptional activation. Hence, CTCF is required
    to insulate facultative heterochromatin from impinging euchromatin to produce
    discrete positional identities.

    and distal sites that include elements resembling enhancers, promoters and CTCF-bound
    sites, their genomic distribution and complex interactions. Because only 7 of
    looping interactions are with the nearest gene, genomic proximity is not a simple
    predictor for long-range interactions.

  abstract: Chromosome conformation capture experiments have led to the discovery
    of dense, contiguous, megabase-sized topological domains that are similar across
    cell types and conserved across species. These domains are strongly correlated
    with a number of chromatin markers and have since been included in a number of
    analyses. However, functionally-relevant domains may exist at multiple length
    scales. We introduce a new and efficient algorithm that is able to capture persistent
    domains across various resolutions by adjusting a single scale parameter. The
    ensemble of domains we identify allows us to quantify the degree to which the
    domain structure is hierarchical as opposed to overlapping, and our analysis reveals
    a pronounced hierarchical structure in which larger stable domains tend to completely
    contain smaller domains. The identified novel domains are substantially different
    from domains reported previously and are highly enriched for insulating factor
    CTCF binding and histone marks at the boundaries.

  title: Expression of a $\beta$-globin gene is enhanced by remote SV40 DNA sequences
  container-title: Cell
  publisher: Cell Press
  page: '299-308'
  volume: '27'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: We have studied the transient expression of a cloned rabbit hemoglobin
    $\beta$1 gene after its introduction into HeLa cells. Two and one-half days after
    transfection using the calcium phosphate technique, we extracted RNA from the
    entire cell population and analyzed it by the S1 nuclease hybridization assay.
    Transcripts were barely detectable when $\beta$-globin gene-plasmid recombinants
    were used. However, 200 times more $\beta$-globin gene transcripts were found
    when the $\beta$-globin gene recombinants also contained SV40 DNA, and 90% of
    these transcripts (about 1000 per cell) had the same 5′ end as authentic rabbit
    globin mRNA. In the latter case, abundant production of $\beta$-globin protein
    was readily detected in a fraction of transfected cells by immunofluorescent staining.
    Enhancement of globin gene expression was dependent on SV40 sequences acting in
    cis, but independent of the viral origin of DNA replication. The enhancing activity
    was associated with the 72 bp repeated sequence element located at the beginning
    of the viral late gene region. Viral DNA fragments containing the transcriptional
    enhancer element could act in either orientation at many positions, including
    1400 bp upstream or 3300 bp downstream from the transcription initiation site
    of the rabbit $\beta$-globin gene. These studies define a class of DNA elements
    with a mode of action that has not been heretofore described. The activation of
    genes by specific enhancer elements seems to be a widespread mechanism that may
    be used for the regulation of gene expression.

  abstract: The Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (CTD; http://ctdbase.org/) provides
    information about interactions between environmental chemicals and gene products
    and their relationships to diseases. Chemical-gene, chemical-disease and gene-disease
    interactions manually curated from the literature are integrated to generate expanded
    networks and predict many novel associations between different data types. CTD
    now contains over 15 million toxicogenomic relationships. To navigate this sea
    of data, we added several new features, including DiseaseComps (which finds comparable
    diseases that share toxicogenomic profiles), statistical scoring for inferred
    gene-disease and pathway-chemical relationships, filtering options for several
    tools to refine user analysis and our new Gene Set Enricher (which provides biological
    annotations that are enriched for gene sets). To improve data visualization, we
    added a Cytoscape Web view to our ChemComps feature, included color-coded interactions
    and created a ’slim list’ for our MEDIC disease vocabulary (allowing diseases
    to be grouped for meta-analysis, visualization and better data management). CTD
    continues to promote interoperability with external databases by providing content
    and cross-links to their sites. Together, this wealth of expanded chemical-gene-disease
    data, combined with novel ways to analyze and view content, continues to help
    users generate testable hypotheses about the molecular mechanisms of environmental
    diseases.

  title: An integrated encyclopedia of DNA elements in the human genome.
  container-title: Nature
  page: '57-74'
  volume: '489'
  issue: '7414'
  abstract: The human genome encodes the blueprint of life, but the function of the
    vast majority of its nearly three billion bases is unknown. The Encyclopedia of
    DNA Elements (ENCODE) project has systematically mapped regions of transcription,
    transcription factor association, chromatin structure and histone modification.
    These data enabled us to assign biochemical functions for 80% of the genome, in
    particular outside of the well-studied protein-coding regions. Many discovered
    candidate regulatory elements are physically associated with one another and with
    expressed genes, providing new insights into the mechanisms of gene regulation.
    The newly identified elements also show a statistical correspondence to sequence
    variants linked to human disease, and can thereby guide interpretation of this
    variation. Overall, the project provides new insights into the organization and
    regulation of our genes and genome, and is an expansive resource of functional
    annotations for biomedical research.

  title: Pseudogenes as an alternative source of natural antisense transcripts
  container-title: BMC Evolutionary Biology
  publisher: BioMed Central
  page: '338'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Naturally occurring antisense transcripts (NATs) are non-coding RNAs that
    may regulate the activity of sense transcripts to which they bind because of complementarity.
    NATs that are not located in the gene they regulate (trans-NATs) have better chances
    to evolve than cis-NATs, which is evident when the sense strand of the cis-NAT
    is part of a protein coding gene. However, the generation of a trans-NAT requires
    the formation of a relatively large region of complementarity to the gene it regulates.
    Pseudogene formation may be one evolutionary mechanism that generates trans-NATs
    to the parental gene. For example, this could occur if the parental gene is regulated
    by a cis-NAT that is copied as a trans-NAT in the pseudogene. To support this
    we identified human pseudogenes with a trans-NAT to the parental gene in their
    antisense strand by analysis of the database of expressed sequence tags (ESTs).
    We found that the mutations that appeared in these trans-NATs after the pseudogene
    formation do not show the flat distribution that would be expected in a non functional
    transcript. Instead, we found higher similarity to the parental gene in a region
    nearby the 3’ end of the trans-NATs. Our results do not imply a functional relation
    of the trans-NAT arising from pseudogenes over their respective parental genes
    but add evidence for it and stress the importance of duplication mechanisms of
    genetic material in the generation of non-coding RNAs. We also provide a plausible
    explanation for the large transcripts that can be found in the antisense strand
    of some pseudogenes.

  abstract: Many patients suffering from developmental disorders harbor submicroscopic
    deletions or duplications that, by affecting the copy number of dosage-sensitive
    genes or disrupting normal gene expression, lead to disease. However, many aberrations
    are novel or extremely rare, making clinical interpretation problematic and genotype-phenotype
    correlations uncertain. Identification of patients sharing a genomic rearrangement
    and having phenotypic features in common leads to greater certainty in the pathogenic
    nature of the rearrangement and enables new syndromes to be defined. To facilitate
    the analysis of these rare events, we have developed an interactive web-based
    database called DECIPHER (Database of Chromosomal Imbalance and Phenotype in Humans
    Using Ensembl Resources) which incorporates a suite of tools designed to aid the
    interpretation of submicroscopic chromosomal imbalance, inversions, and translocations.
    DECIPHER catalogs common copy-number changes in normal populations and thus, by
    exclusion, enables changes that are novel and potentially pathogenic to be identified.
    DECIPHER enhances genetic counseling by retrieving relevant information from a
    variety of bioinformatics resources. Known and predicted genes within an aberration
    are listed in the DECIPHER patient report, and genes of recognized clinical importance
    are highlighted and prioritized. DECIPHER enables clinical scientists worldwide
    to maintain records of phenotype and chromosome rearrangement for their patients
    and, with informed consent, share this information with the wider clinical research
    community through display in the genome browser Ensembl. By sharing cases worldwide,
    clusters of rare cases having phenotype and structural rearrangement in common
    can be identified, leading to the delineation of new syndromes and furthering
    understanding of gene function.

  page: '58-64'

  issue: '7269'
  abstract: Genomes are organized into high-level three-dimensional structures, and
    DNA elements separated by long genomic distances can in principle interact functionally.
    Many transcription factors bind to regulatory DNA elements distant from gene promoters.
    Although distal binding sites have been shown to regulate transcription by long-range
    chromatin interactions at a few loci, chromatin interactions and their impact
    on transcription regulation have not been investigated in a genome-wide manner.
    Here we describe the development of a new strategy, chromatin interaction analysis
    by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET) for the de novo detection of global chromatin
    interactions, with which we have comprehensively mapped the chromatin interaction
    network bound by oestrogen receptor alpha (ER-alpha) in the human genome. We found
    that most high-confidence remote ER-alpha-binding sites are anchored at gene promoters
    through long-range chromatin interactions, suggesting that ER-alpha functions
    by extensive chromatin looping to bring genes together for coordinated transcriptional
    regulation. We propose that chromatin interactions constitute a primary mechanism
    for regulating transcription in mammalian genomes.

  title: Evolutionarily Conserved Principles Predict 3D Chromatin Organization
  container-title: Molecular Cell
  publisher: Elsevier Inc.
  page: '1-16'
  abstract: 'Fax: 404-727-2880 SUMMARY Compartments, TADs, and CTCF loop domains
    have been identified as important structural and functional components of 3D chromatin
    organization, yet the relationship between these features is not well understood.
    Here we show that chromatin is organized by a hierarchy of interactions primarily
    determined by transcription. Indeed, transcription is a major predictor of Hi-C
    contact maps in all tested eukaryotes, including C. elegans and A. thaliana. Architectural
    proteins have an additional function by insulating neighboring transcriptional
    domains in Drosophila, but CTCF loops do not play a distinct and key role in this
    organism. Transcription also predicts chromatin organization in mammals, but interactions
    mediated by CTCF add an extra critical layer of organizational control. The results
    suggest that transcriptional compartments and CTCF loops, rather than TADs, are
    the structural and functional units of chromosome organization for all eukaryotes,
    with CTCF and other architectural proteins acquiring an increasingly important
    role during mammalian evolution.'

  abstract: Accurate functional annotation of regulatory elements is essential for
    understanding global gene regulation. Here, we report a genome-wide map of 827,000
    transcription factor binding sites in human lymphoblastoid cell lines, which is
    comprised of sites corresponding to 239 position weight matrices of known transcription
    factor binding motifs, and 49 novel sequence motifs. To generate this map, we
    developed a probabilistic framework that integrates cell- or tissue-specific experimental
    data such as histone modifications and DNase I cleavage patterns with genomic
    information such as gene annotation and evolutionary conservation. Comparison
    to empirical ChIP-seq data suggests that our method is highly accurate yet has
    the advantage of targeting many factors in a single assay. We anticipate that
    this approach will be a valuable tool for genome-wide studies of gene regulation
    in a wide variety of cell types or tissues under diverse conditions.

  abstract: Enhancers control the correct temporal and cell-type-specific activation
    of gene expression in multicellular eukaryotes. Knowing their properties, regulatory
    activity and targets is crucial to understand the regulation of differentiation
    and homeostasis. Here we use the FANTOM5 panel of samples, covering the majority
    of human tissues and cell types, to produce an atlas of active, in vivo-transcribed
    enhancers. We show that enhancers share properties with CpG-poor messenger RNA
    promoters but produce bidirectional, exosome-sensitive, relatively short unspliced
    RNAs, the generation of which is strongly related to enhancer activity. The atlas
    is used to compare regulatory programs between different cells at unprecedented
    depth, to identify disease-associated regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms,

    the utility of enhancer redundancy, which explains gene expression strength rather
    than expression patterns. The online FANTOM5 enhancer atlas represents a unique

  title: Describing Sequencing Results of Structural Chromosome Rearrangements with
    a Suggested Next-Generation Cytogenetic Nomenclature

  abstract: With recent rapid advances in genomic technologies, precise delineation
    of structural chromosome rearrangements at the nucleotide level is becoming increasingly
    feasible. In this era of “next-generation cytogenetics” (i.e., an integration
    of traditional cytogenetic techniques and next-generation sequencing), a consensus
    nomenclature is essential for accurate communication and data sharing. Currently,
    nomenclature for describing the sequencing data of these aberrations is lacking.
    Herein, we present a system called Next-Gen Cytogenetic Nomenclature, which is
    concordant with the International System for Human Cytogenetic Nomenclature (2013).
    This system starts with the alignment of rearrangement sequences by BLAT or BLAST
    (alignment tools) and arrives at a concise and detailed description of chromosomal
    changes. To facilitate usage and implementation of this nomenclature, we are developing
    a program designated BLA(S)T Output Sequence Tool of Nomenclature (BOSToN), a
    demonstrative version of which is accessible online. A standardized characterization
    of structural chromosomal rearrangements is essential both for research analyses
    and for application in the clinical setting.

  page: '20204-11'
  volume: '109'
  issue: '50'
  abstract: Copy number variations are genomic structural variants that are frequently
    associated with human diseases. Among these copy number variations, duplications
    of DNA segments are often assumed to lead to dosage effects by increasing the
    copy number of either genes or their regulatory elements. We produced a series
    of large targeted duplications within a conserved gene desert upstream of the
    murine HoxD locus. This DNA region, syntenic to human 2q31-32, contains a range
    of regulatory elements required for Hoxd gene transcription, and it is often disrupted
    and/or reorganized in human genetic conditions collectively known as the 2q31
    syndrome. Unexpectedly, one such duplication led to a transcriptional down-regulation
    in developing digits by impairing physical interactions between the target genes
    and their upstream regulatory elements, thus phenocopying the effect obtained
    when these enhancer sequences are deleted. These results illustrate the detrimental
    consequences of interrupting highly conserved regulatory landscapes and reveal
    a mechanism where genomic duplications lead to partial loss of function of nearby
    located genes.

  abstract: Understanding the functional consequences of genetic variation, and how
    it affects complex human disease and quantitative traits, remains a critical challenge
    for biomedicine. We present an analysis of RNA sequencing data from 1641 samples
    across 43 tissues from 175 individuals, generated as part of the pilot phase of
    the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project. We describe the landscape of gene
    expression across tissues, catalog thousands of tissue-specific and shared regulatory
    expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) variants, describe complex network relationships,
    and identify signals from genome-wide association studies explained by eQTLs.
    These findings provide a systematic understanding of the cellular and biological
    consequences of human genetic variation and of the heterogeneity of such effects
    among a diverse set of human tissues.$\backslash$nExpression, genetic variation,
    and tissues$\backslash$nHuman genomes show extensive genetic variation across
    individuals, but we have only just started documenting the effects of this variation
    on the regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, only a few tissues have been
    examined per genetic variant. In order to examine how genetic expression varies
    among tissues within individuals, the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Consortium
    collected 1641 postmortem samples covering 54 body sites from 175 individuals.
    They identified quantitative genetic traits that affect gene expression and determined
    which of these exhibit tissue-specific expression patterns. Melé et al. measured
    how transcription varies among tissues, and Rivas et al. looked at how truncated
    protein variants affect expression across tissues.$\backslash$nScience, this issue

  abstract: We discuss here a series of testable hypotheses concerning the role of
    chromosome folding into topologically associating domains (TADs). Several lines
    of evidence suggest that segmental packaging of chromosomal neighborhoods may
    underlie features of chromatin that span large domains, such as heterochromatin
    blocks, association with the nuclear lamina and replication timing. By defining
    which DNA elements preferentially contact each other, the segmentation of chromosomes
    into TADs may also underlie many properties of long-range transcriptional regulation.
    Several observations suggest that TADs can indeed provide a structural basis to
    regulatory landscapes, by controlling enhancer sharing and allocation. We also
    discuss how TADs may shape the evolution of chromosomes, by causing maintenance
    of synteny over large chromosomal segments. Finally we suggest a series of experiments
    to challenge these ideas and provide concrete examples illustrating how they could
    be practically applied.

  abstract: Genomic experiments produce multiple views of biological systems, among
    them are DNA sequence and copy number variation, and mRNA and protein abundance.
    Understanding these systems needs integrated bioinformatic analysis. Public databases
    such as Ensembl provide relationships and mappings between the relevant sets of
    probe and target molecules. However, the relationships can be biologically complex
    and the content of the databases is dynamic. We demonstrate how to use the computational
    environment R to integrate and jointly analyze experimental datasets, employing
    BioMart web services to provide the molecule mappings. We also discuss typical
    problems that are encountered in making gene-to-transcript-to-protein mappings.
    The approach provides a flexible, programmable and reproducible basis for state-of-the-art
    bioinformatic data integration.

  title: Genomic regulatory blocks encompass multiple neighboring genes and maintain

  container-title: Genome Research
  page: '545-555'
  volume: '17'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: We report evidence for a mechanism for the maintenance of long-range conserved
    synteny across vertebrate genomes. We found the largest mammal-teleost conserved
    chromosomal segments to be spanned by highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs),
    their developmental regulatory target genes, and phylogenetically and functionally
    unrelated "bystander" genes. Bystander genes are not specifically under the control
    of the regulatory elements that drive the target genes and are expressed in patterns
    that are different from those of the target genes. Reporter insertions distal
    to zebrafish developmental regulatory genes pax6.1/2, rx3, id1, and fgf8 and miRNA
    genes mirn9-1 and mirn9-5 recapitulate the expression patterns of these genes
    even if located inside or beyond bystander genes, suggesting that the regulatory
    domain of a developmental regulatory gene can extend into and beyond adjacent
    transcriptional units. We termed these chromosomal segments genomic regulatory
    blocks (GRBs). After whole genome duplication in teleosts, GRBs, including HCNEs
    and target genes, were often maintained in both copies, while bystander genes
    were typically lost from one GRB, strongly suggesting that evolutionary pressure
    acts to keep the single-copy GRBs of higher vertebrates intact. We show that loss
    of bystander genes and other mutational events suffered by duplicated GRBs in
    teleost genomes permits target gene identification and HCNE/target gene assignment.
    These findings explain the absence of evolutionary breakpoints from large vertebrate
    chromosomal segments and will aid in the recognition of position effect mutations
    within human GRBs.

    underlies gene regulation
  abstract: Chromatin loops juxtapose distal enhancers with active promoters, but
    their molecular architecture and relationship with transcription remain unclear.
    In erythroid cells, the locus control region (LCR) and $\beta$-globin promoter
    form a chromatin loop that requires transcription factor GATA1 and the associated
    molecule Ldb1. We employed artificial zinc fingers (ZF) to tether Ldb1 to the
    $\beta$-globin promoter in GATA1 null erythroblasts, in which the $\beta$-globin
    locus is relaxed and inactive. Remarkably, targeting Ldb1 or only its self-association
    domain to the $\beta$-globin promoter substantially activated $\beta$-globin transcription
    in the absence of GATA1. Promoter-tethered Ldb1 interacted with endogenous Ldb1
    complexes at the LCR to form a chromatin loop, causing recruitment and phosphorylation
    of RNA polymerase II. ZF-Ldb1 proteins were inactive at alleles lacking the LCR,
    demonstrating that their activities depend on long-range interactions. Our findings
    establish Ldb1 as a critical effector of GATA1-mediated loop formation and indicate
    that chromatin looping causally underlies gene regulation.

  abstract: Increasing evidence suggests that interactions between regulatory genomic
    elements play an important role in regulating gene expression. We generated a
    genome-wide interaction map of regulatory elements in human cells (ENCODE tier
    1 cells, K562, GM12878) using Chromatin Interaction Analysis by Paired-End Tag
    sequencing (ChIA-PET) experiments targeting six broadly distributed factors. Bound
    regions covered 80% of DNase I hypersensitive sites including 99.7% of TSS and
    98% of enhancers. Correlating this map with ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data sets revealed
    cohesin, CTCF, and ZNF143 as key components of three-dimensional (3D) chromatin
    structure and revealed how distal chromatin state affects gene transcription.
    Comparison of interactions between cell types revealed that enhancerpromoter interactions
    were highly cell-type specific. Construction and comparison of distal and proximal
    regulatory networks revealed stark differences in structure and biological function.
    Proximal binding events are enriched at genes with housekeeping functions while
    distal binding events interact with genes involved in dynamic biological processes
    including response to stimulus. This study reveals new mechanistic and functional
    insights into regulatory region organization in the nucleus.

  abstract: Over the past 10 years, the development of chromosome conformation capture
    (3C) technology and the subsequent genomic variants thereof have enabled the analysis
    of nuclear organization at an unprecedented resolution and throughput. The technology
    relies on the original and, in hindsight, remarkably simple idea that digestion
    and religation of fixed chromatin in cells, followed by the quantification of
    ligation junctions, allows for the determination of DNA contact frequencies and
    insight into chromosome topology. Here we evaluate and compare the current 3C-based
    methods (including 4C \[chromosome conformation capture-on-chip\], 5C \[chromosome
    conformation capture carbon copy\], HiC, and ChIA-PET), summarize their contribution
    to our current understanding of genome structure, and discuss how shape influences
    genome function.

  abstract: Mammalian chromosomes fold into arrays of megabase-sized topologically
    associating domains (TADs), which are arranged into compartments spanning multiple
    megabases of genomic DNA. TADs have internal substructures that are often cell
    type specific, but their higher-order organization remains elusive. Here, we investigate
    TAD higher-order interactions with Hi-C through neuronal differentiation and show
    that they form a hierarchy of domains-within-domains (metaTADs) extending across
    genomic scales up to the range of entire chromosomes. We find that TAD interactions
    are well captured by tree-like, hierarchical structures irrespective of cell type.
    metaTAD tree structures correlate with genetic, epigenomic and expression features,
    and structural tree rearrangements during differentiation are linked to transcriptional
    state changes. Using polymer modelling, we demonstrate that hierarchical folding
    promotes efficient chromatin packaging with-out the loss of contact specificity,
    highlighting a role far beyond the simple need for packing efficiency.

  abstract: The Human Genetic Cell Repository sponsored by the National Institute
    of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) contains more than 11,000 cell lines and DNA
    samples collected from numerous individuals. All of these cell lines and DNA samples
    are categorized into several collections representing a variety of disease states,
    chromosomal abnormalities, heritable diseases, distinct human populations, and
    apparently healthy individuals. Many of these cell lines have previously been
    studied with detailed conventional cytogenetic analyses, including G-banded karyotyping
    and fluorescence in situ hybridization. This work was conducted by investigators
    at submitting institutions and scientists at Coriell Institute for Medical Research,
    where the NIGMS Repository is hosted. Recently, approximately 900 cell lines,
    mostly chosen from the Chromosomal Aberrations and Heritable Diseases collections,
    have been further characterized in detail at the Coriell Institute using the Affymetrix
    Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 to detect copy number variations and copy number
    neutral loss of heterozygosity. A database containing detailed cytogenetic and
    genomic information for these cell lines has been constructed and is freely available
    through several sources, such as the NIGMS Repository website and the University
    of California at Santa Cruz Genome Browser. As additional cell lines are analyzed
    and subsequently added into it, the database will be maintained dynamically.

  title: Topologically associating domains and their long-range contacts are established
    during early G1 coincident with the establishment of the replication-timing program.
  container-title: Genome research
  publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press
  page: '1104-13'
  volume: '25'
  issue: '8'
  abstract: Mammalian genomes are partitioned into domains that replicate in a defined
    temporal order. These domains can replicate at similar times in all cell types
    (constitutive) or at cell type-specific times (developmental). Genome-wide chromatin
    conformation capture (Hi-C) has revealed sub-megabase topologically associating
    domains (TADs), which are the structural counterparts of replication domains.
    Hi-C also segregates inter-TAD contacts into defined 3D spatial compartments that
    align precisely to genome-wide replication timing profiles. Determinants of the
    replication-timing program are re-established during early G1 phase of each cell
    cycle and lost in G2 phase, but it is not known when TAD structure and inter-TAD
    contacts are re-established after their elimination during mitosis. Here, we use
    multiplexed 4C-seq to study dynamic changes in chromatin organization during early
    G1. We find that both establishment of TADs and their compartmentalization occur
    during early G1, within the same time frame as establishment of the replication-timing
    program. Once established, this 3D organization is preserved either after withdrawal
    into quiescence or for the remainder of interphase including G2 phase, implying
    3D structure is not sufficient to maintain replication timing. Finally, we find
    that developmental domains are less well compartmentalized than constitutive domains
    and display chromatin properties that distinguish them from early and late constitutive
    domains. Overall, this study uncovers a strong connection between chromatin re-organization
    during G1, establishment of replication timing, and its developmental control.

  title: Co-regulation of paralog genes in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture
  container-title: Nucleic Acids Research
  page: '81-91'
  volume: '45'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Paralog genes arise from gene duplication events during evolution, which
    often lead to similar proteins that cooperate in common pathways and in protein
    complexes. Consequently, paralogs show correlation in gene expression whereby
    the mechanisms of co-regulation remain unclear. In eukaryotes, genes are regulated
    in part by distal enhancer elements through looping interactions with gene promoters.
    These looping interactions can be measured by genome-wide chromatin conformation
    capture (Hi-C) experiments, which revealed self-interacting regions called topologically
    associating domains (TADs). We hypothesize that paralogs share common regulatory
    mechanisms to enable coordinated expression according to TADs. To test this hypothesis,
    we integrated paralogy annotations with human gene expression data in diverse
    tissues, genome-wide enhancer-promoter associations and Hi-C experiments in human,
    mouse and dog genomes. We show that paralog gene pairs are enriched for co-localization
    in the same TAD, share more often common enhancer elements than expected and have
    increased contact frequencies over large genomic distances. Combined, our results
    indicate that paralogs share common regulatory mechanisms and cluster not only
    in the linear genome but also in the three-dimensional chromatin architecture.
    This enables concerted expression of paralogs over diverse cell-types and indicate
    evolutionary constraints in functional genome organization.

  volume: '467'
  issue: '7311'
  abstract: The International HapMap Consortium, established to develop a haplotype
    map of the human genome describing the common patterns of DNA sequence variation,
    has now reached its third incarnation. HapMap1, published in 2005 (go.nature.com/gJisDm),
    contained more than a million SNP (single nucleotide polymorphism) genotypes generated
    in 269 individuals from four geographically diverse populations. Two years later,
    HapMap2 (go.nature.com/WttNWX) added more than 2.1 million SNPs to the original
    map in the same 269 individuals. With the aim of providing a resource for the
    latest wave of genome-wide studies focused on disease linkages, HapMap3 casts
    the net wider. About 1.6 million common SNPs were genotyped in 1,184 individuals
    from 11 global populations, and ten 100-kilobase regions were sequenced in 692
    of these individuals.

  abstract: The precise expression of genes in time and space during embryogenesis
    is largely influenced by communication between enhancers and promoters, which
    is propagated and governed by the physical proximity of these elements in the
    nucleus. Here, we review how chromatin domains organize the genome by guiding
    enhancers to their target genes thereby preventing non-specific interactions with
    other neighboring regions. We also discuss the dynamics of chromatin interactions
    between enhancers and promoters, as well as the consequent changes in gene expression,
    that occur in pluripotent cells and during development. Finally, we evaluate how
    genomic changes such as deletions, inversions and duplications affect 3D chromatin
    configuration overall and lead to ectopic enhancer-promoter contacts, and thus
    gene misexpression, which can contribute to abnormal development and disease.

  title: Chromatin extrusion explains key features of loop and domain formation in
    wild-type and engineered genomes
  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences
  page: '201518552'
  volume: '112'
  issue: '47'
  abstract: We recently used in situ Hi-C to create kilobase-resolution 3D maps of
    mammalian genomes. Here, we combine these maps with new Hi-C, microscopy, and
    genome-editing experiments to study the physical structure of chromatin fibers,
    domains, and loops. We find that the observed contact domains are inconsistent
    with the equilibrium state for an ordinary condensed polymer. Combining Hi-C data
    and novel mathematical theorems, we show that contact domains are also not consistent
    with a fractal globule. Instead, we use physical simulations to study two models
    of genome folding. In one, intermonomer attraction during polymer condensation
    leads to formation of an anisotropic "tension globule." In the other, CCCTC-binding
    factor (CTCF) and cohesin act together to extrude unknotted loops during interphase.
    Both models are consistent with the observed contact domains and with the observation
    that contact domains tend to form inside loops. However, the extrusion model explains
    a far wider array of observations, such as why loops tend not to overlap and why
    the CTCF-binding motifs at pairs of loop anchors lie in the convergent orientation.
    Finally, we perform 13 genome-editing experiments examining the effect of altering
    CTCF-binding sites on chromatin folding. The convergent rule correctly predicts
    the affected loops in every case. Moreover, the extrusion model accurately predicts
    in silico the 3D maps resulting from each experiment using only the location of
    CTCF-binding sites in the WT. Thus, we show that it is possible to disrupt, restore,
    and move loops and domains using targeted mutations as small as a single base
    pair.

  title: A role for noncoding variation in schizophrenia.
  container-title: Cell reports
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: '1417-29'
  volume: '9'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: A large portion of common variant loci associated with genetic risk for
    schizophrenia reside within noncoding sequence of unknown function. Here, we demonstrate
    promoter and enhancer enrichment in schizophrenia variants associated with expression
    quantitative trait loci (eQTL). The enrichment is greater when functional annotations
    derived from the human brain are used relative to peripheral tissues. Regulatory
    trait concordance analysis ranked genes within schizophrenia genome-wide significant
    loci for a potential functional role, based on colocalization of a risk SNP, eQTL,
    and regulatory element sequence. We identified potential physical interactions
    of noncontiguous proximal and distal regulatory elements. This was verified in
    prefrontal cortex and -induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons for the L-type
    calcium channel (CACNA1C) risk locus. Our findings point to a functional link
    between schizophrenia-associated noncoding SNPs and 3D genome architecture associated
    with chromosomal loopings and transcriptional regulation in the brain.

  page: '792-8'
  volume: '17'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Pseudogenes have long been labeled as "junk" DNA, failed copies of genes
    that arise during the evolution of genomes. However, recent results are challenging
    this moniker; indeed, some pseudogenes appear to harbor the potential to regulate
    their protein-coding cousins. Far from being silent relics, many pseudogenes are
    transcribed into RNA, some exhibiting a tissue-specific pattern of activation.
    Pseudogene transcripts can be processed into short interfering RNAs that regulate
    coding genes through the RNAi pathway. In another remarkable discovery, it has
    been shown that pseudogenes are capable of regulating tumor suppressors and oncogenes
    by acting as microRNA decoys. The finding that pseudogenes are often deregulated
    during cancer progression warrants further investigation into the true extent
    of pseudogene function. In this review, we describe the ways in which pseudogenes
    exert their effect on coding genes and explore the role of pseudogenes in the
    increasingly complex web of noncoding RNA that contributes to normal cellular
    regulation.

  abstract: Insect genomes contain larger blocks of conserved gene order (microsynteny)
    than would be expected under a random breakage model of chromosome evolution.
    We present evidence that microsynteny has been retained to keep large arrays of
    highly conserved noncoding elements (HCNEs) intact. These arrays span key developmental
    regulatory genes, forming genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs). We recently described
    GRBs in vertebrates, where most HCNEs function as enhancers and HCNE arrays specify
    complex expression programs of their target genes. Here we present a comparison
    of five Drosophila genomes showing that HCNE density peaks centrally in large
    synteny blocks containing multiple genes. Besides developmental regulators that
    are likely targets of HCNE enhancers, HCNE arrays often span unrelated neighboring
    genes. We describe differences in core promoters between the target genes and
    the unrelated genes that offer an explanation for the differences in their responsiveness
    to enhancers. We show examples of a striking correspondence between boundaries
    of synteny blocks, HCNE arrays, and Polycomb binding regions, confirming that
    the synteny blocks correspond to regulatory domains. Although few noncoding elements
    are highly conserved between Drosophila and the malaria mosquito Anopheles gambiae,
    we find that A. gambiae regions orthologous to Drosophila GRBs contain an equivalent
    distribution of noncoding elements highly conserved in the yellow fever mosquito
    Aëdes aegypti and coincide with regions of ancient microsynteny between Drosophila
    and mosquitoes. The structural and functional equivalence between insect and vertebrate
    GRBs marks them as an ancient feature of metazoan genomes and as a key to future
    studies of development and gene regulation.

    data for human and model organisms. The Browser displays many sequencing-based
    data sets across all or part of the genome, on specific gene sets or pathways,
    and in the context of their metadata. Investigators can order, filter, aggregate,
    classify, and display data interactively based on given feature sets including
    metadata features, annotated biological pathways, and user-defined collections
    of genes or genomic coordinates. Further, statistical tests can be performed on
    selected data. Individual labs can upload their sequencing or array-based data
    as custom tracks and display them in the context of consortium data, allowing
    for direct comparisons. The Browser is an increasingly important and widely accessible
    tool for deriving biological insights from unprecedented amounts of high-quality
    genomic, epigenomic, and expression data.

    - conservation across cell types - co-regualtion of genes across differentiation
    TADs function arise from parition of interactions and specific regulatory sequences
  abstract: Understanding how regulatory sequences interact in the context of chromosomal
    architecture is a central challenge in biology. Chromosome conformation capture
    revealed that mammalian chromosomes possess a rich hierarchy of structural layers,
    from multi-megabase compartments to sub-megabase topologically associating domains
    (TADs) and sub-TAD contact domains. TADs appear to act as regulatory microenvironments
    by constraining and segregating regulatory interactions across discrete chromosomal
    regions. However, it is unclear whether other (or all) folding layers share similar
    properties, or rather TADs constitute a privileged folding scale with maximal
    impact on the organization of regulatory interactions. Here we present a novel
    algorithm named CaTCH that identifies hierarchical trees of chromosomal domains
    in Hi-C maps, stratified through their reciprocal physical insulation, which is
    a single and biologically relevant parameter. By applying CaTCH to published Hi-C
    datasets, we show that previously reported folding layers appear at different
    insulation levels. We demonstrate that although no structurally privileged folding
    level exists, TADs emerge as a functionally privileged scale defined by maximal
    boundary enrichment in CTCF and maximal cell-type conservation. By measuring transcriptional
    output in embryonic stem cells and neural precursor cells, we show that the likelihood
    that genes in a domain are co-regulated during differentiation is also maximized
    at the scale of TADs. Finally, we observe that regulatory sequences occur at genomic
    locations corresponding to optimized mutual interactions at the same scale. Our
    analysis suggests that the architectural functionality of TADs arises from the
    interplay between their ability to partition interactions and the specific genomic
    position of regulatory sequences.

  title: Coregulation of tandem duplicate genes slows evolution of subfunctionalization
    in mammals.
  container-title: Science (New York, N.Y.)
  page: '1009-13'
  volume: '352'
  issue: '6288'
  abstract: Gene duplication is a fundamental process in genome evolution. However,
    most young duplicates are degraded by loss-of-function mutations, and the factors
    that allow some duplicate pairs to survive long-term remain controversial. One
    class of models to explain duplicate retention invokes sub- or neofunctionalization,
    whereas others focus on sharing of gene dosage. RNA-sequencing data from 46 human
    and 26 mouse tissues indicate that subfunctionalization of expression evolves
    slowly and is rare among duplicates that arose within the placental mammals, possibly
    because tandem duplicates are coregulated by shared genomic elements. Instead,
    consistent with the dosage-sharing hypothesis, most young duplicates are down-regulated
    to match expression levels of single-copy genes. Thus, dosage sharing of expression
    allows for the initial survival of mammalian duplicates, followed by slower functional
    adaptation enabling long-term preservation.

    Can Be Caused by Haploinsufficiency ofRIEG, but Also by Chromosome Breaks ≈90

  abstract: The autosomal dominant disorder Rieger syndrome (RIEG) shows genetic heterogeneity
    and has a phenotype characterized by malformations of the anterior segment of
    the eye, failure of the periumbilical skin to involute, and dental hypoplasia.
    The main locus for RIEG was mapped to the 4q25–q27 chromosomal segment using a
    series of cytogenetic abnormalities as well as by genetic linkage to DNA markers.
    Recently, abicoid-related homeobox transcription factor gene calledRIEGhas been
    cloned, characterized, and proven to cause the 4q25 linked RIEG. Its mode of action
    in the pathogenesis of RIEG was not conclusively proven, since most etiological
    mutations detected in theRIEGsequence caused amino acid substitutions or splice
    changes in the homeodomain. Through FISH analysis of a 460-kb sequence-ready map
    (PAC contig) aroundRIEGthat we report in this paper, we demonstrate that the 4q25
    linked RIEG disorder can arise from the haploid, whole-gene deletion ofRIEG, but
    also from a translocation break 90 kb upstream from the gene. The data provide
    conclusive evidence that physical or functional haploinsufficiency of RIEG is
    the pathogenic mechanism for Rieger syndrome. The map also defines restriction
    fragments bearing sequences with a potential key regulatory role in the control
    of homeobox gene expression.

  abstract: Formaldehyde has been used for decades to probe macromolecular structure
    and function and to trap complexes, cells, and tissues for further analysis. Formaldehyde
    crosslinking is routinely employed for detection and quantification of protein-DNA
    interactions, interactions between chromatin proteins, and interactions between
    distal segments of the chromatin fiber. Despite widespread use and a rich biochemical
    literature, important aspects of formaldehyde behavior in cells have not been
    well described. Here, we highlight features of formaldehyde chemistry relevant
    to its use in analyses of chromatin complexes, focusing on how its properties
    may influence studies of chromatin structure and function.

  abstract: Structural variations of DNA greater than 1 kilobase in size account for
    most bases that vary among human genomes, but are still relatively under-ascertained.
    Here we use tiling oligonucleotide microarrays, comprising 42 million probes,
    to generate a comprehensive map of 11,700 copy number variations (CNVs) greater
    than 443 base pairs, of which most (8,599) have been validated independently.
    For 4,978 of these CNVs, we generated reference genotypes from 450 individuals
    of European, African or East Asian ancestry. The predominant mutational mechanisms
    differ among CNV size classes. Retrotransposition has duplicated and inserted
    some coding and non-coding DNA segments randomly around the genome. Furthermore,
    by correlation with known trait-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
    we identified 30 loci with CNVs that are candidates for influencing disease susceptibility.
    Despite this, having assessed the completeness of our map and the patterns of
    linkage disequilibrium between CNVs and SNPs, we conclude that, for complex traits,
    the heritability void left by genome-wide association studies will not be accounted
    for by common CNVs.

  abstract: In vertebrates and other Metazoa, developmental genes are found surrounded
    by dense clusters of highly conserved noncoding elements (CNEs). CNEs exhibit
    extreme levels of sequence conservation of unexplained origin, with many acting
    as long-range enhancers during development. Clusters of CNEs, termed genomic regulatory
    blocks (GRBs), define the span of regulatory interactions for many important developmental
    regulators. The function and genomic distribution of these elements close to important
    regulatory genes raises the question of how they relate to the 3D conformation
    of these loci. We show that GRBs, defined using clusters of CNEs, coincide strongly
    with the patterns of topological organisation in metazoan genomes, precisely predicting
    the boundaries of topologically associating domains (TADs) at hundreds of loci.
    The set of TADs that are associated with high levels of non-coding conservation,
    which we term devTADs, exhibit distinct properties compared to TADs called in
    chromosomal regions devoid of extreme non-coding conservation. The correspondence
    between GRBs and TADs suggests that TADs around developmental genes are ancient,
    slowly evolving genomic structures, many of which have had conserved spans for
    hundreds of millions of years. This relationship also explains the difference
    in TAD numbers and sizes between genomes. While the close correlation between
    extreme conservation and the boundaries of this subset of TADs does not reveal
    the mechanism leading to the conservation of these elements, it provides a functional
    framework for studying the role of TADs in long-range transcriptional regulation.

    2,000 unidentified individuals from 20 populations around the world. This first
    paper presents the results from the project’s pilot phase, testing three different
    strategies for genome-wide sequencing with high-throughput platforms: low-coverage
    whole-genome sequencing of 179 individuals in three population groups, high-coverage
    sequencing of two motherfatherchild trios, and exon-targeted sequencing of 697
    individuals from seven populations.'

  title: The accessible chromatin landscape of the human genome.
  container-title: Nature
  publisher: Nature Publishing Group
  page: '75-82'
  volume: '489'
  issue: '7414'
  abstract: DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) are markers of regulatory DNA and
    have underpinned the discovery of all classes of cis-regulatory elements including
    enhancers, promoters, insulators, silencers and locus control regions. Here we
    present the first extensive map of human DHSs identified through genome-wide profiling
    in 125 diverse cell and tissue types. We identify ∼2.9 million DHSs that encompass
    virtually all known experimentally validated cis-regulatory sequences and expose
    a vast trove of novel elements, most with highly cell-selective regulation. Annotating
    these elements using ENCODE data reveals novel relationships between chromatin
    accessibility, transcription, DNA methylation and regulatory factor occupancy
    patterns. We connect ∼580,000 distal DHSs with their target promoters, revealing
    systematic pairing of different classes of distal DHSs and specific promoter types.
    Patterning of chromatin accessibility at many regulatory regions is organized
    with dozens to hundreds of co-activated elements, and the transcellular DNase I
    sensitivity pattern at a given region can predict cell-type-specific functional
    behaviours. The DHS landscape shows signatures of recent functional evolutionary
    constraint. However, the DHS compartment in pluripotent and immortalized cells
    exhibits higher mutation rates than that in highly differentiated cells, exposing
    an unexpected link between chromatin accessibility, proliferative potential and
    patterns of human variation.

  title: \<i\>FTO\</i\> Obesity Variant Circuitry and Adipocyte Browning in Humans
  container-title: New England Journal of Medicine
  page: '895-907'
  volume: '373'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: BACKGROUND Genomewide association studies can be used to identify disease-relevant
    genomic regions, but interpretation of the data is challenging. The FTO region
    harbors the strongest genetic association with obesity, yet the mechanistic basis
    of this association remains elusive. METHODS We examined epigenomic data, allelic
    activity, motif conservation, regulator expression, and gene coexpression patterns,
    with the aim of dissecting the regulatory circuitry and mechanistic basis of the
    association between the FTO region and obesity. We validated our predictions with
    the use of directed perturbations in samples from patients and from mice and with
    endogenous CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing in samples from patients. RESULTS Our data
    indicate that the FTO allele associated with obesity represses mitochondrial thermogenesis
    in adipocyte precursor cells in a tissue-autonomous manner. The rs1421085 T-to-C
    single-nucleotide variant disrupts a conserved motif for the ARID5B repressor,
    which leads to derepression of a potent preadipocyte enhancer and a doubling of
    IRX3 and IRX5 expression during early adipocyte differentiation. This results
    in a cell-autonomous developmental shift from energy-dissipating beige (brite)
    adipocytes to energy-storing white adipocytes, with a reduction in mitochondrial
    thermogenesis by a factor of 5, as well as an increase in lipid storage. Inhibition
    of Irx3 in adipose tissue in mice reduced body weight and increased energy dissipation
    without a change in physical activity or appetite. Knockdown of IRX3 or IRX5 in
    primary adipocytes from participants with the risk allele restored thermogenesis,
    increasing it by a factor of 7, and overexpression of these genes had the opposite
    effect in adipocytes from nonrisk-allele carriers. Repair of the ARID5B motif
    by CRISPR-Cas9 editing of rs1421085 in primary adipocytes from a patient with
    the risk allele restored IRX3 and IRX5 repression, activated browning expression
    programs, and restored thermogenesis, increasing it by a factor of 7. CONCLUSIONS
    Our results point to a pathway for adipocyte thermogenesis regulation involving
    ARID5B, rs1421085, IRX3, and IRX5, which, when manipulated, had pronounced pro-obesity
    and anti-obesity effects. (Funded by the German Research Center for Environmental
    Health and others.).

  abstract: The University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser Database (GBD)
    contains sequence and annotation data for the genomes of about a dozen vertebrate
    species and several major model organisms. Genome annotations typically include
    assembly data, sequence composition, genes and gene predictions, mRNA and expressed
    sequence tag evidence, comparative genomics, regulation, expression and variation
    data. The database is optimized to support fast interactive performance with web
    tools that provide powerful visualization and querying capabilities for mining
    the data. The Genome Browser displays a wide variety of annotations at all scales
    from single nucleotide level up to a full chromosome. The Table Browser provides
    direct access to the database tables and sequence data, enabling complex queries
    on genome-wide datasets. The Proteome Browser graphically displays protein properties.
    The Gene Sorter allows filtering and comparison of genes by several metrics including
    expression data and several gene properties. BLAT and In Silico PCR search for
    sequences in entire genomes in seconds. These tools are highly integrated and
    provide many hyperlinks to other databases and websites. The GBD, browsing tools,
    downloadable data files and links to documentation and other information can be

  volume: '17'

  abstract: Serum-to-2i interconversion of mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) is a
    valuable in vitro model for early embryonic development. To assess whether 3D
    chromatin organization changes during this transition, we established Capture
    Hi-C with target-sequence enrichment of DNase I hypersensitive sites. We detected
    extremely long-range intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions between a small
    subset of H3K27me3 marked bivalent promoters involving the Hox clusters in serum-grown
    cells. Notably, these promoter-mediated interactions are not present in 2i ground-state
    pluripotent mESCs but appear upon their further development into primed-like serum
    mESCs. Reverting serum mESCs to ground-state 2i mESCs removes these promoter-promoter
    interactions in a spatiotemporal manner. H3K27me3, which is largely absent at
    bivalent promoters in ground-state 2i mESCs, is necessary, but not sufficient,
    to establish these interactions, as confirmed by Capture Hi-C on Eed−/− serum
    mESCs. Our results implicate H3K27me3 and PRC2 as critical players in chromatin
    alteration during priming of ESCs for differentiation.

  abstract: Eukaryotic transcription can be regulated over tens or even hundreds of
    kilobases. We show that such long-range gene regulation in vivo involves spatial
    interactions between transcriptional elements, with intervening chromatin looping
    out. The spatial organization of a 200 kb region spanning the murine beta-globin
    locus was analyzed in expressing erythroid and nonexpressing brain tissue. In
    brain, the globin cluster adopts a seemingly linear conformation. In erythroid
    cells the hypersensitive sites of the locus control region (LCR), located 40-60
    kb away from the active genes, come in close spatial proximity with these genes.
    The intervening chromatin with inactive globin genes loops out. Moreover, two
    distant hypersensitive regions participate in these interactions. We propose that
    clustering of regulatory elements is key to creating and maintaining active chromatin
    domains and regulating transcription.

  volume: '16'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Chromosome translocations are catastrophic genomic events and often play
    key roles in tumorigenesis. Yet the biogenesis of chromosome translocations is
    remarkably poorly understood. Recent work has delineated several distinct mechanistic
    steps in the formation of translocations, and it has become apparent that non-random
    spatial genome organization, DNA repair pathways and chromatin features, including
    histone marks and the dynamic motion of broken chromatin, are critical for determining
    translocation frequency and partner selection.

  title: Next-Generation Sequencing Strategies Enable Routine Detection of Balanced
    Chromosome Rearrangements for Clinical Diagnostics and Genetic Research
  container-title: The American Journal of Human Genetics
  publisher: Cell Press
  page: '469-481'
  volume: '88'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: The contribution of balanced chromosomal rearrangements to complex disorders
    remains unclear because they are not detected routinely by genome-wide microarrays
    and clinical localization is imprecise. Failure to consider these events bypasses
    a potentially powerful complement to single nucleotide polymorphism and copy-number
    association approaches to complex disorders, where much of the heritability remains
    unexplained. To capitalize on this genetic resource, we have applied optimized
    sequencing and analysis strategies to test whether these potentially high-impact
    variants can be mapped at reasonable cost and throughput. By using a whole-genome
    multiplexing strategy, rearrangement breakpoints could be delineated at a fraction
    of the cost of standard sequencing. For rearrangements already mapped regionally
    by karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization, a targeted approach enabled
    capture and sequencing of multiple breakpoints simultaneously. Importantly, this
    strategy permitted capture and unique alignment of up to 97% of repeat-masked
    sequences in the targeted regions. Genome-wide analyses estimate that only 3.7%
    of bases should be routinely omitted from genomic DNA capture experiments. Illustrating
    the power of these approaches, the rearrangement breakpoints were rapidly defined
    to base pair resolution and revealed unexpected sequence complexity, such as co-occurrence
    of inversion and translocation as an underlying feature of karyotypically balanced
    alterations. These findings have implications ranging from genome annotation to
    de novo assemblies and could enable sequencing screens for structural variations
    at a cost comparable to that of microarrays in standard clinical practice.

  container-title: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States

  page: '7672-7'
  volume: '100'
  issue: '13'
  abstract: The human and mouse genomic sequences provide evidence for a larger number
    of rearrangements than previously thought and reveal extensive reuse of breakpoints
    from the same short fragile regions. Breakpoint clustering in regions implicated
    in cancer and infertility have been reported in previous studies; we report here
    on breakpoint clustering in chromosome evolution. This clustering reveals limitations
    of the widely accepted random breakage theory that has remained unchallenged since
    the mid-1980s. The genome rearrangement analysis of the human and mouse genomes
    implies the existence of a large number of very short "hidden" synteny blocks
    that were invisible in the comparative mapping data and ignored in the random
    breakage model. These blocks are defined by closely located breakpoints and are
    often hard to detect. Our results suggest a model of chromosome evolution that
    postulates that mammalian genomes are mosaics of fragile regions with high propensity
    for rearrangements and solid regions with low propensity for rearrangements.

  issue: '6280'

  abstract: Oncogenes are activated through well-known chromosomal alterations such
    as gene fusion, translocation, and focal amplification. In light of recent evidence
    that the control of key genes depends on chromosome structures called insulated
    neighborhoods, we investigated whether proto-oncogenes occur within these structures
    and whether oncogene activation can occur via disruption of insulated neighborhood
    boundaries in cancer cells. We mapped insulated neighborhoods in T cell acute
    lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and found that tumor cell genomes contain recurrent
    microdeletions that eliminate the boundary sites of insulated neighborhoods containing
    prominent T-ALL proto-oncogenes. Perturbation of such boundaries in nonmalignant
    cells was sufficient to activate proto-oncogenes. Mutations affecting chromosome
    neighborhood boundaries were found in many types of cancer. Thus, oncogene activation
    can occur via genetic alterations that disrupt insulated neighborhoods in malignant
    cells.

  title: Large clusters of co-expressed genes in the Drosophila genome

  page: '666-669'
  volume: '420'
  issue: December
  abstract: Clustering of co-expressed, non-homologous genes on chromosomes implies
    their co-regulation. In lower eukaryotes, co-expressed genes are often found in
    pairs. Clustering of genes that share aspects of transcriptional regulation has
    also been reported in higher eukaryotes. To advance our understanding of the mode
    of coordinated gene regulation in multicellular organisms, we performed a genome-wide
    analysis of the chromosomal distribution of co-expressed genes in Drosophila.
    We identified a total of 1,661 testes-specific genes, one-third of which are clustered
    on chromosomes. The number of clusters of three or more genes is much higher than
    expected by chance. We observed a similar trend for genes upregulated in the embryo
    and in the adult head, although the expression pattern of individual genes cannot
    be predicted on the basis of chromosomal position alone. Our data suggest that
    the prevalent mechanism of transcriptional co-regulation in higher eukaryotes
    operates with extensive chromatin domains that comprise multiple genes

  abstract: Predicting which genomic regions control the transcription of a given
    gene is a challenge. We present a novel computational approach for creating and
    validating maps that associate genomic regions (cis-regulatory modules-CRMs) with
    genes. The method infers regulatory relationships that explain gene expression
    observed in a test tissue using widely available genomic data for ’other’ tissues.
    To predict the regulatory targets of a CRM, we use cross-tissue correlation between
    histone modifications present at the CRM and expression at genes within 1 Mbp
    of it. To validate cis-regulatory maps, we show that they yield more accurate
    models of gene expression than carefully constructed control maps. These gene
    expression models predict observed gene expression from transcription factor binding
    in the CRMs linked to that gene. We show that our maps are able to identify long-range
    regulatory interactions and improve substantially over maps linking genes and
    CRMs based on either the control maps or a ’nearest neighbor’ heuristic. Our results
    also show that it is essential to include CRMs predicted in multiple tissues during
    map-building, that H3K27ac is the most informative histone modification, and that
    CAGE is the most informative measure of gene expression for creating cis-regulatory
    maps.

  annote: Mouse data - enhancer and promoter activity over 19 tissues
  abstract: The laboratory mouse is the most widely used mammalian model organism
    in biomedical research. The 2.6 × 10(9) bases of the mouse genome possess a high
    degree of conservation with the human genome, so a thorough annotation of the
    mouse genome will be of significant value to understanding the function of the
    human genome. So far, most of the functional sequences in the mouse genome have
    yet to be found, and the cis-regulatory sequences in particular are still poorly
    annotated. Comparative genomics has been a powerful tool for the discovery of
    these sequences, but on its own it cannot resolve their temporal and spatial functions.
    Recently, ChIP-Seq has been developed to identify cis-regulatory elements in the
    genomes of several organisms including humans, Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis
    elegans. Here we apply the same experimental approach to a diverse set of 19 tissues
    and cell types in the mouse to produce a map of nearly 300,000 murine cis-regulatory
    sequences. The annotated sequences add up to 11% of the mouse genome, and include
    more than 70% of conserved non-coding sequences. We define tissue-specific enhancers
    and identify potential transcription factors regulating gene expression in each
    tissue or cell type. Finally, we show that much of the mouse genome is organized
    into domains of coordinately regulated enhancers and promoters. Our results provide
    a resource for the annotation of functional elements in the mammalian genome and
    for the study of mechanisms regulating tissue-specific gene expression.

  abstract: Chromosome translocations are a hallmark of cancer cells. We have developed
    an experimental system to visualize the formation of translocations in living
    cells and apply it to characterize the spatial and dynamic properties of translocation
    formation. We demonstrate that translocations form within hours of the occurrence
    of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and that their formation is cell cycle-independent.
    Translocations form preferentially between prepositioned genome elements, and
    perturbation of key factors of the DNA repair machinery uncouples DSB pairing
    from translocation formation. These observations generate a spatiotemporal framework
    for the formation of translocations in living cells.

  abstract: How regulatory elements spatially interact with their target DNA sequences
    is unclear. The $\beta$-globin locus control region (LCR) is found to take part
    in interchromosomal interactions with a few genes controlled by shared transcription
    factors, and to transcriptionally upregulate $\beta$-globin mRNA in a subset of
    cells.

    in Disease'
  container-title: Am. J. Hum. Genet
  page: '8-32'
  volume: '76'
  abstract: Transcriptional control is a major mechanism for regulating gene expression.
    The complex machinery required to effect this control is still emerging from functional
    and evolutionary analysis of genomic architecture. In addition to the promoter,
    many other regulatory elements are required for spatiotemporally and quantitatively
    correct gene expression. Enhancer and repressor elements may reside in introns
    or up-and downstream of the transcription unit. For some genes with highly complex
    expression patterns—often those that function as key developmental control genes—the
    cis-regulatory domain can extend long distances outside the transcription unit.
    Some of the earliest hints of this came from disease-associated chromosomal breaks
    positioned well outside the relevant gene. With the availability of wide-ranging
    genome sequence comparisons, strong conservation of many noncoding regions became
    obvious. Functional studies have shown many of these conserved sites to be transcriptional
    regulatory elements that sometimes reside inside unrelated neighboring genes.
    Such sequence-conserved elements generally harbor sites for tissue-specific DNA-binding
    proteins. Developmentally variable chromatin conformation can control protein
    access to these sites and can regulate transcription. Disruption of these finely
    tuned mechanisms can cause disease. Some regulatory element mutations will be
    associated with phenotypes distinct from any identified for coding-region mutations.

  abstract: We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture
    of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel
    sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C
    at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories
    and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional
    level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation
    of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase
    scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free,
    polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the
    ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct
    from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate
    the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.

  title: Deletions of chromosomal regulatory boundaries are associated with congenital
    disease
  container-title: Genome Biology
  page: '423'
  volume: '15'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: Recent data from genome-wide chromosome conformation capture analysis
    indicate that the human genome is divided into conserved megabase-sized self-interacting
    regions called topological domains. These topological domains form the regulatory
    backbone of the genome and are separated by regulatory boundary elements or barriers.
    Copy-number variations can potentially alter the topological domain architecture
    by deleting or duplicating the barriers and thereby allowing enhancers from neighboring
    domains to ectopically activate genes causing misexpression and disease, a mutational
    mechanism that has recently been termed enhancer adoption. We use the Human Phenotype
    Ontology database to relate the phenotypes of 922 deletion cases recorded in the
    DECIPHER database to monogenic diseases associated with genes in or adjacent to
    the deletions. We identify combinations of tissue-specific enhancers and genes
    adjacent to the deletion and associated with phenotypes in the corresponding tissue,
    whereby the phenotype matched that observed in the deletion. We compare this computationally
    with a gene-dosage pathomechanism that attempts to explain the deletion phenotype
    based on haploinsufficiency of genes located within the deletions. Up to 11.8%
    of the deletions could be best explained by enhancer adoption or a combination
    of enhancer adoption and gene-dosage effects. Our results suggest that enhancer
    adoption caused by deletions of regulatory boundaries may contribute to a substantial
    minority of copy-number variation phenotypes and should thus be taken into account
    in their medical interpretation.

  abstract: Eukaryotic cells make many types of primary and processed RNAs that are
    found either in specific subcellular compartments or throughout the cells. A complete
    catalogue of these RNAs is not yet available and their characteristic subcellular
    localizations are also poorly understood. Because RNA represents the direct output
    of the genetic information encoded by genomes and a significant proportion of
    a cell’s regulatory capabilities are focused on its synthesis, processing, transport,
    modification and translation, the generation of such a catalogue is crucial for
    understanding genome function. Here we report evidence that three-quarters of
    the human genome is capable of being transcribed, as well as observations about
    the range and levels of expression, localization, processing fates, regulatory
    regions and modifications of almost all currently annotated and thousands of previously
    unannotated RNAs. These observations, taken together, prompt a redefinition of
    the concept of a gene.

  volume: '44'
  issue: November 2015
  abstract: JASPAR (http://jaspar.genereg.net) is an open-access database storing
    curated, non-redundant transcription factor (TF) binding profiles representing
    transcription factor binding preferences as position frequency matrices for multiple
    species in six taxonomic groups. For this 2016 release, we expanded the JASPAR
    CORE collection with 494 new TF binding profiles (315 in vertebrates, 11 in nematodes,
    3 in insects, 1 in fungi and 164 in plants) and updated 59 profiles (58 in vertebrates
    and 1 in fungi). The introduced profiles represent an 83% expansion and 10% update
    when compared to the previous release. We updated the structural annotation of
    the TF DNA binding domains (DBDs) following a published hierarchical structural
    classification. In addition, we introduced 130 transcription factor flexible models
    trained on ChIP-seq data for vertebrates, which capture dinucleotide dependencies
    within TF binding sites. This new JASPAR release is accompanied by a new web tool
    to infer JASPAR TF binding profiles recognized by a given TF protein sequence.
    Moreover, we provide the users with a Ruby module complementing the JASPAR API
    to ease programmatic access and use of the JASPAR collection of profiles. Finally,
    we provide the JASPAR2016 R/Bioconductor data package with the data of this release.

  container-title: Molecular Cell
  page: '471-484'
  volume: '48'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: The mechanisms responsible for the establishment of physical domains in
    metazoan chromosomes are poorly understood. Here we find that physical domains
    in Drosophila chromosomes are demarcated at regions of active transcription and
    high gene density that are enriched for transcription factors and specific combinations
    of insulator proteins. Physical domains contain different types of chromatin defined
    by the presence of specific proteins and epigenetic marks, with active chromatin
    preferentially located at the borders and silenced chromatin in the interior.
    Domain boundaries participate in long-range interactions that may contribute to
    the clustering of regions of active or silenced chromatin in the nucleus. Analysis
    of transgenes suggests that chromatin is more accessible and permissive to transcription
    at the borders than inside domains, independent of the presence of active or silencing
    histone modifications. These results suggest that the higher-order physical organization
    of chromatin may impose an additional level of regulation over classical epigenetic
    marks. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

    with GFP-tagged chromatin. Positional changes of the intensity gravity centers
    of fluorescently labeled chromosome territories (CTs) on the order of several
    microm were observed in early G1, suggesting a role of CT mobility in establishing
    interphase nuclear architecture. Thereafter, the positions were highly constrained
    within a range of approximately 1 microm until the end of G2. To analyze possible
    changes of chromosome arrangements from one cell cycle to the next, nuclei were
    photobleached in G2 maintaining a contiguous zone of unbleached chromatin at one
    nuclear pole. This zone was stably preserved until the onset of prophase, whereas
    the contiguity of unbleached chromosome segments was lost to a variable extent,
    when the metaphase plate was formed. Accordingly, chromatin patterns observed
    in daughter nuclei differed significantly from the mother cell nucleus. We conclude
    that CT arrangements were stably maintained from mid G1 to late G2/early prophase,
    whereas major changes of CT neighborhoods occurred from one cell cycle to the
    next. The variability of CT neighborhoods during clonal growth was further confirmed
    by chromosome painting experiments.

  title: ZNF143 provides sequence specificity to secure chromatin interactions at
    gene promoters
  container-title: Nature Communications
  page: '6186'
  volume: '2'
  abstract: Chromatin interactions connect distal regulatory elements to target gene
    promoters guiding stimulus-and lineage-specific transcription. Few factors securing
    chromatin interactions have so far been identified. Here, by integrating chromatin
    interaction maps with the large collection of transcription factor-binding profiles
    provided by the ENCODE project, we demonstrate that the zinc-finger protein ZNF143
    preferentially occupies anchors of chromatin interactions connecting promoters
    with distal regulatory elements. It binds directly to promoters and associates
    with lineage-specific chromatin interactions and gene expression. Silencing ZNF143
    or modulating its DNA-binding affinity using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
    as a surrogate of site-directed mutagenesis reveals the sequence dependency of
    chromatin interactions at gene promoters. We also find that chromatin interactions
    alone do not regulate gene expression. Together, our results identify ZNF143 as
    a novel chromatin-looping factor that contributes to the architectural foundation
    of the genome by providing sequence specificity at promoters connected with distal
    regulatory elements.

  title: Chromatin stretch enhancer states drive cell-specific gene regulation and

  page: '17921-6'
  volume: '110'

  abstract: Chromatin-based functional genomic analyses and genomewide association
    studies (GWASs) together implicate enhancers as critical elements influencing
    gene expression and risk for common diseases. Here, we performed systematic chromatin
    and transcriptome profiling in human pancreatic islets. Integrated analysis of
    islet data with those from nine cell types identified specific and significant
    enrichment of type 2 diabetes and related quantitative trait GWAS variants in
    islet enhancers. Our integrated chromatin maps reveal that most enhancers are
    short (median = 0.8 kb). Each cell type also contains a substantial number of
    more extended (≥ 3 kb) enhancers. Interestingly, these stretch enhancers are often
    tissue-specific and overlap locus control regions, suggesting that they are important
    chromatin regulatory beacons. Indeed, we show that (i) tissue specificity of enhancers
    and nearby gene expression increase with enhancer length; (ii) neighborhoods containing
    stretch enhancers are enriched for important cell type-specific genes; and (iii)
    GWAS variants associated with traits relevant to a particular cell type are more
    enriched in stretch enhancers compared with short enhancers. Reporter constructs
    containing stretch enhancer sequences exhibited tissue-specific activity in cell
    culture experiments and in transgenic mice. These results suggest that stretch
    enhancers are critical chromatin elements for coordinating cell type-specific
    regulatory programs and that sequence variation in stretch enhancers affects risk
    of major common human diseases.

  abstract: How DNA is organized in three dimensions inside the cell nucleus and how

    capture technology (such as 3C, 4C, 5C and Hi-C), the spatial organization of
    genomes is being explored at unprecedented resolution. Interpreting the increasingly

    describe several types of statistical and computational approaches that have recently
    been developed to analyse chromatin interaction data.

  abstract: Topological domains are key architectural building blocks of chromosomes,
    but their functional importance and evolutionary dynamics are not well defined.
    We performed comparative high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C)
    in four mammals and characterized the conservation and divergence of chromosomal
    contact insulation and the resulting domain architectures within distantly related
    genomes. We show that the modular organization of chromosomes is robustly conserved
    in syntenic regions and that this is compatible with conservation of the binding
    landscape of the insulator protein CTCF. Specifically, conserved CTCF sites are
    co-localized with cohesin, are enriched at strong topological domain borders,
    and bind to DNA motifs with orientations that define the directionality of CTCF’s
    long-range interactions. Conversely, divergent CTCF binding between species is
    correlated with divergence of internal domain structure, likely driven by local
    CTCF binding sequence changes, demonstrating how genome evolution can be linked
    to a continuous flux of local conformation changes. We also show that large-scale
    domains are reorganized during genome evolution as intact modules.

  title: The precision-recall plot is more informative than the ROC plot when evaluating
    binary classifiers on imbalanced datasets
  container-title: PLoS ONE
  page: '1-21'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Binary classifiers are routinely evaluated with performance measures such
    as sensitivity and specificity, and performance is frequently illustrated with
    Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) plots. Alternative measures such as positive
    predictive value (PPV) and the associated Precision/Recall (PRC) plots are used
    less frequently. Many bioinformatics studies develop and evaluate classifiers
    that are to be applied to strongly imbalanced datasets in which the number of
    negatives outweighs the number of positives significantly. While ROC plots are
    visually appealing and provide an overview of a classifier’s performance across
    a wide range of specificities, one can ask whether ROC plots could be misleading
    when applied in imbalanced classification scenarios. We show here that the visual
    interpretability of ROC plots in the context of imbalanced datasets can be deceptive
    with respect to conclusions about the reliability of classification performance,
    owing to an intuitive but wrong interpretation of specificity. PRC plots, on the
    other hand, can provide the viewer with an accurate prediction of future classification
    performance due to the fact that they evaluate the fraction of true positives
    among positive predictions. Our findings have potential implications for the interpretation
    of a large number of studies that use ROC plots on imbalanced datasets.

  title: ChIP-exo signal associated with DNA-binding motifs provide insights into
    the genomic binding of the glucocorticoid receptor and cooperating transcription
    factors.
  container-title: Genome research
  page: '825-35'
  volume: '25'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: The classical DNA recognition sequence of the glucocorticoid receptor
    (GR) appears to be present at only a fraction of bound genomic regions. To identify
    sequences responsible for recruitment of this transcription factor (TF) to individual
    loci, we turned to the high-resolution ChIP-exo approach. We exploited this signal
    by determining footprint profiles of TF binding at single base pair resolution
    using ExoProfiler, a computational pipeline based on DNA binding motifs. When
    applied to our GR and the few available public ChIP-exo datasets, we find that
    ChIP-exo footprints are protein- and recognition sequence-specific signatures
    of genomic TF association. Furthermore, we show that ChIP-exo captures information
    about TFs other than the one directly targeted by the antibody in the ChIP-procedure.
    Consequently, the shape of the ChIP-exo footprint can be used to discriminate
    between direct and indirect (tethering to other DNA-bound proteins) DNA association
    of GR. Together, our findings indicate that the absence of classical recognition
    sequences can be explained by direct GR binding to a broader spectrum of sequences
    than previously known, either as homodimer, or as a heterodimer binding together
    with a member of the ETS or TEAD families of TFs, or alternatively by indirect
    recruitment via FOX or STAT proteins. ChIP-exo footprints also bring structural
    insights and locate DNA:protein cross-link points that are compatible with crystal
    structures of the studied TFs. Overall, our generically applicable footprint-based
    approach uncovers new structural and functional insights into the diverse ways
    of genomic cooperation and association of TFs.

  title: A single oncogenic enhancer rearrangement causes concomitant EVI1 and GATA2
    deregulation in leukemia.
  container-title: Cell
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: '369-381'
  volume: '157'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Chromosomal rearrangements without gene fusions have been implicated in
    leukemogenesis by causing deregulation of proto-oncogenes via relocation of cryptic
    regulatory DNA elements. AML with inv(3)/t(3;3) is associated with aberrant expression
    of the stem-cell regulator EVI1. Applying functional genomics and genome-engineering,
    we demonstrate that both 3q rearrangements reposition a distal GATA2 enhancer
    to ectopically activate EVI1 and simultaneously confer GATA2 functional haploinsufficiency,
    previously identified as the cause of sporadic familial AML/MDS and MonoMac/Emberger
    syndromes. Genomic excision of the ectopic enhancer restored EVI1 silencing and
    led to growth inhibition and differentiation of AML cells, which could be replicated
    by pharmacologic BET inhibition. Our data show that structural rearrangements
    involving the chromosomal repositioning of a single enhancer can cause deregulation
    of two unrelated distal genes, with cancer as the outcome.

  annote: \- separating proportion of expression associated with genome organisation
    from other sources - positionally attributable expression accounts for a considerable
    proportion of total levels and is hihgly inofrmative of TADs acitivty and organization
  abstract: Transcriptional regulation is tightly coupled with chromosomal positioning
    and three-dimensional chromatin architecture. However, it is unclear what proportion
    of transcriptional activity is reflecting such organisation, how much can be informed
    by RNA expression alone and how this impacts disease. Here, we develop a computational
    transcriptional decomposition approach separating the proportion of expression
    associated with genome organisation from independent effects not directly related
    to genomic positioning. We show that positionally attributable expression accounts
    for a considerable proportion of total levels and is highly informative of topological
    associating domain activities and organisation, revealing boundaries and chromatin
    compartments. Furthermore, expression data alone accurately predict individual
    enhancer–promoter interactions, drawing features from expression strength, stabilities,
    insulation and distance. We characterise predictions in 76 human cell types, observing
    extensive sharing of domains, yet highly cell-type-specific enhancer–promoter
    interactions and strong enrichments in relevant trait-associated variants. Overall,
    our work demonstrates a close relationship between transcription and chromatin
    architecture.

  container-title: Science (New York, N.Y.)
  page: '613-7'
  volume: '309'
  issue: '5734'
  abstract: The genome organizations of eight phylogenetically distinct species from
    five mammalian orders were compared in order to address fundamental questions
    relating to mammalian chromosomal evolution. Rates of chromosome evolution within
    mammalian orders were found to increase since the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.
    Nearly 20% of chromosome breakpoint regions were reused during mammalian evolution;
    these reuse sites are also enriched for centromeres. Analysis of gene content
    in and around evolutionary breakpoint regions revealed increased gene density
    relative to the genome-wide average. We found that segmental duplications populate
    the majority of primate-specific breakpoints and often flank inverted chromosome
    segments, implicating their role in chromosomal rearrangement.

  volume: '6'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Much of what we know about the chromatin-based mechanisms that regulate
    gene expression in mammals has come from the study of what are, paradoxically,
    atypical genes. These are clusters of structurally and/or functionally related
    genes that are coordinately regulated during development, or between different
    cell types. Can unravelling the mechanisms of gene regulation at these gene clusters
    help us to understand how other genes are controlled? Moreover, can it explain
    why there is clustering of apparently unrelated genes in mammalian genomes?

  container-title: Human Genomics

  page: '30'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: Copy number variants (CNVs) are important contributors to the human pathogenic
    genetic diversity as demonstrated by a number of cases reported in the literature.
    The high homology between repetitive elements may guide genomic stability which
    will give rise to CNVs either by non-allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) or
    non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Here, we present a short guide based on previously
    documented cases of disease-associated CNVs in order to provide a general view
    on the impact of repeated elements on the stability of the genomic sequence and
    consequently in the origin of the human pathogenic variome.

  page: '996-1006'
  volume: '12'
  issue: '6'
  abstract: As vertebrate genome sequences near completion and research refocuses
    to their analysis, the issue of effective genome annotation display becomes critical.
    A mature web tool for rapid and reliable display of any requested portion of the
    genome at any scale, together with several dozen aligned annotation tracks, is
    provided at http://genome.ucsc.edu. This browser displays assembly contigs and
    gaps, mRNA and expressed sequence tag alignments, multiple gene predictions, cross-species
    homologies, single nucleotide polymorphisms, sequence-tagged sites, radiation
    hybrid data, transposon repeats, and more as a stack of coregistered tracks. Text
    and sequence-based searches provide quick and precise access to any region of
    specific interest. Secondary links from individual features lead to sequence details
    and supplementary off-site databases. One-half of the annotation tracks are computed
    at the University of California, Santa Cruz from publicly available sequence data;
    collaborators worldwide provide the rest. Users can stably add their own custom
    tracks to the browser for educational or research purposes. The conceptual and
    technical framework of the browser, its underlying MYSQL database, and overall
    use are described. The web site currently serves over 50,000 pages per day to
    over 3000 different users.

    open-source tool for analyzing terabase-scale Hi-C datasets. Juicer allows users
    without a computational background to transform raw sequence data into normalized
    contact maps with one click. Juicer produces a hic file containing compressed
    contact matrices at many resolutions, facilitating visualization and analysis
    at multiple scales. Structural features, such as loops and domains, are automatically
    annotated. Juicer is available as open source software at http://aidenlab.org/juicer/.

  abstract: The Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) project, available at http://www.human-phenotype-ontology.org,
    provides a structured, comprehensive and well-defined set of 10,088 classes (terms)
    describing human phenotypic abnormalities and 13,326 subclass relations between
    the HPO classes. In addition we have developed logical definitions for 46% of
    all HPO classes using terms from ontologies for anatomy, cell types, function,
    embryology, pathology and other domains. This allows interoperability with several
    resources, especially those containing phenotype information on model organisms
    such as mouse and zebrafish. Here we describe the updated HPO database, which
    provides annotations of 7,278 human hereditary syndromes listed in OMIM, Orphanet
    and DECIPHER to classes of the HPO. Various meta-attributes such as frequency,
    references and negations are associated with each annotation. Several large-scale
    projects worldwide utilize the HPO for describing phenotype information in their
    datasets. We have therefore generated equivalence mappings to other phenotype
    vocabularies such as LDDB, Orphanet, MedDRA, UMLS and phenoDB, allowing integration
    of existing datasets and interoperability with multiple biomedical resources.
    We have created various ways to access the HPO database content using flat files,
    a MySQL database, and Web-based tools. All data and documentation on the HPO project
    can be found online.

  container-title: Cell Reports
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: '471-484'
  volume: '10'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Cellular senescence has been implicated in tumor suppression, development,
    and aging and is accompanied by large-scale chromatin rearrangements, forming
    senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). However, how the chromatin
    is reorganized during SAHF formation is poorly understood. Furthermore, heterochromatin
    formation in senescence appears to contrast with loss of heterochromatin in Hutchinson-Gilford
    progeria. We mapped architectural changes in genome organization in cellular senescence
    using Hi-C. Unexpectedly, we find a dramatic sequence- and lamin-dependent loss
    of local interactions in heterochromatin. This change in local connectivity resolves
    the paradox of opposing chromatin changes in senescence and progeria. In addition,
    we observe a senescence-specific spatial clustering of heterochromatic regions,
    suggesting a unique second step required for SAHF formation. Comparison of embryonic
    stem cells (ESCs), somatic cells, and senescentcells shows a unidirectional loss
    in local chromatin connectivity, suggesting that senescence is an endpoint of
    thecontinuous nuclear remodelling process during differentiation.

  abstract: Biologists have long sought to understand which genes and what kinds of
    changes in their sequences are responsible for the evolution of morphological
    diversity. Here, I outline eight principles derived from molecular and evolutionary
    developmental biology and review recent studies of species divergence that have
    led to a genetic theory of morphological evolution, which states that (1) form
    evolves largely by altering the expression of functionally conserved proteins,
    and (2) such changes largely occur through mutations in the cis-regulatory sequences
    of pleiotropic developmental regulatory loci and of the target genes within the
    vast networks they control.

  page: '206-217'
  volume: '101'

  abstract: Interpretation of variants of uncertain significance, especially chromosomal
    rearrangements in non-coding regions of the human genome, remains one of the biggest
    challenges in modern molecular diagnosis. To improve our understanding and interpretation
    of such variants, we used high-resolution three-dimensional chromosomal structural
    data and transcriptional regulatory information to predict position effects and
    their association with pathogenic phenotypes in 17 subjects with apparently balanced
    chromosomal abnormalities. We found that the rearrangements predict disruption
    of long-range chromatin interactions between several enhancers and genes whose
    annotated clinical features are strongly associated with the subjects’ phenotypes.
    We confirm gene-expression changes for a couple of candidate genes to exemplify
    the utility of our analysis of position effect. These results highlight the important
    interplay between chromosomal structure and disease and demonstrate the need to
    utilize chromatin conformational data for the prediction of position effects in
    the clinical interpretation of non-coding chromosomal rearrangements.

  issue: April
  abstract: Genome function, replication, integrity, and propagation rely on the dynamic
    structural organization of chromosomes during the cell cycle. Genome folding in
    interphase provides regulatory segmentation for appropriate transcriptional control,
    facilitates ordered genome replication, and contributes to genome integrity by
    limiting illegitimate recombination. Here, we review recent high-resolution chromosome
    conformation capture and functional studies that have informed models of the spatial
    and regulatory compartmentalization of mammalian genomes, and discuss mechanistic
    models for how CTCF and cohesin control the functional architecture of mammalian
    chromosomes.

  title: Integrative annotation of human large intergenic noncoding RNAs reveals global
    properties and specific subclasses.
  container-title: Genes & development
  publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press
  page: '1915-27'
  volume: '25'
  issue: '18'
  abstract: Large intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) are emerging as key regulators
    of diverse cellular processes. Determining the function of individual lincRNAs
    remains a challenge. Recent advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and computational
    methods allow for an unprecedented analysis of such transcripts. Here, we present
    an integrative approach to define a reference catalog of \>8000 human lincRNAs.
    Our catalog unifies previously existing annotation sources with transcripts we
    assembled from RNA-seq data collected from ∼4 billion RNA-seq reads across 24
    tissues and cell types. We characterize each lincRNA by a panorama of \>30 properties,
    including sequence, structural, transcriptional, and orthology features. We found
    that lincRNA expression is strikingly tissue-specific compared with coding genes,
    and that lincRNAs are typically coexpressed with their neighboring genes, albeit
    to an extent similar to that of pairs of neighboring protein-coding genes. We
    distinguish an additional subset of transcripts that have high evolutionary conservation
    but may include short ORFs and may serve as either lincRNAs or small peptides.
    Our integrated, comprehensive, yet conservative reference catalog of human lincRNAs
    reveals the global properties of lincRNAs and will facilitate experimental studies
    and further functional classification of these genes.

    conservation by number and conservation of surrounding enhnacers and promoters
  abstract: 'To gain insight into how mammalian gene expression is controlled by
    rapidly evolving regulatory elements, we jointly analysed promoter and enhancer
    activity with downstream transcription levels in liver samples from twenty species.
    Genes associated with complex regulatory landscapes generally exhibit high expression
    levels that remain evolutionarily stable. While the number of regulatory elements
    is the key driver of transcriptional output and resilience, regulatory conservation
    matters: elements active across mammals most effectively stabilise gene expression.
    In contrast, recently-evolved enhancers typically contribute weakly, consistent
    with their high evolutionary plasticity. These effects are observed across the
    entire mammalian clade and robust to potential confounders, such as gene expression
    level. Overall, our results illuminate how the evolutionary stability of gene
    expression is profoundly entwined with both the number and conservation of surrounding
    promoters and enhancers.'

  abstract: An increasing number of human diseases are recognized to result from recurrent
    DNA rearrangements involving unstable genomic regions. These are termed genomic
    disorders, in which the clinical phenotype is a consequence of abnormal dosage
    of gene(s) located within the rearranged genomic fragments. Both inter- and intrachromosomal
    rearrangements are facilitated by the presence of region-specific low-copy repeats
    (LCRs) and result from nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between paralogous
    genomic segments. LCRs usually span ∼10–400 kb of genomic DNA, share ≥ 97% sequence
    identity, and provide the substrates for homologous recombination, thus predisposing
    the region to rearrangements. Moreover, it has been suggested that higher order
    genomic architecture involving LCRs plays a significant role in karyotypic evolution
    accompanying primate speciation.

  annote: From Duplicate 2 (VISTA Enhancer Browser–a database of tissue-specific human
    enhancers.- Visel, Axel; Minovitsky, Simon; Dubchak, Inna; Pennacchio, Len a )
  abstract: Despite the known existence of distant-acting cis-regulatory elements
    in the human genome, only a small fraction of these elements has been identified
    and experimentally characterized in vivo. This paucity of enhancer collections
    with defined activities has thus hindered computational approaches for the genome-wide
    prediction of enhancers and their functions. To fill this void, we utilize comparative
    genome analysis to identify candidate enhancer elements in the human genome coupled
    with the experimental determination of their in vivo enhancer activity in transgenic
    mice \[L. A. Pennacchio et al. (2006) Nature, in press\]. These data are available
    through the VISTA Enhancer Browser (http://enhancer.lbl.gov). This growing database
    currently contains over 250 experimentally tested DNA fragments, of which more
    than 100 have been validated as tissue-specific enhancers. For each positive enhancer,
    we provide digital images of whole-mount embryo staining at embryonic day 11.5
    and an anatomical description of the reporter gene expression pattern. Users can
    retrieve elements near single genes of interest, search for enhancers that target
    reporter gene expression to a particular tissue, or download entire collections
    of enhancers with a defined tissue specificity or conservation depth. These experimentally
    validated training sets are expected to provide a basis for a wide range of downstream
    computational and functional studies of enhancer function.

  annote: \- use indirect peaks from ChIP-seq to predict chromatin loops - no use
    of CTCF motifs
  abstract: Eukaryotic chromosomes are partitioned into topologically associating
    domains (TADs) that are demarcated by distinct insulator-binding proteins (IBPs)
    in Drosophila. Whether IBPs regulate specific long-range contacts and how this
    may impact gene expression remains unclear. Here we identify "indirect peaks"
    of multiple IBPs that represent their distant sites of interactions through long-range
    contacts. Indirect peaks depend on protein-protein interactions among multiple
    IBPs and their common cofactors, including CP190, as confirmed by high-resolution
    analyses of long-range contacts. Mutant IBPs unable to interact with CP190 impair
    long-range contacts as well as the expression of hundreds of distant genes that
    are specifically flanked by indirect peaks. Regulation of distant genes strongly
    correlates with RNAPII pausing, highlighting how this key transcriptional stage
    may trap insulator-based long-range interactions. Our data illustrate how indirect
    peaks may decipher gene regulatory networks through specific long-range interactions.

  page: '780-788'
  volume: '4'
  issue: '5'
  annote: \- correlation between the degree of intermingling of chrom pairs in translocation
    frequencies
  abstract: After mitosis, mammalian chromosomes partially decondense to occupy distinct
    territories in the cell nucleus. Current models propose that territories are separated
    by an interchromatin domain, rich in soluble nuclear machinery, where only rare
    interchromosomal interactions can occur via extended chromatin loops. In contrast,
    recent evidence for chromatin mobility and high frequency of chromosome translocations
    are consistent with significant levels of chromosome intermingling, with important
    consequences for genome function and stability. Here we use a novel high-resolution
    in situ hybridization procedure that preserves chromatin nanostructure to show
    that chromosome territories intermingle significantly in the nucleus of human
    cells. The degree of intermingling between specific chromosome pairs in human
    lymphocytes correlates with the frequency of chromosome translocations in the
    same cell type, implying that double-strand breaks formed within areas of intermingling
    are more likely to participate in interchromosomal rearrangements. The presence
    of transcription factories in regions of intermingling and the effect of transcription
    impairment on the interactions between chromosomes shows that transcription-dependent
    interchromosomal associations shape chromosome organization in mammalian cells.
    These findings suggest that local chromatin conformation and gene transcription
    influence the extent with which chromosomes interact and affect their overall
    properties, with direct consequences for cell-type specific genome stability.

  volume: '66'

  abstract: 'The study of enhancers has been hampered by the scarcity of methods
    to systematically quantify their endogenous activity. We develop Mosaic-seq to
    systematically perturb enhancers and measure their endogenous activities at single-cell
    resolution. Mosaic-seq uses a CRISPR barcoding system to jointly measure a cell’s
    transcriptome and its sgRNA modulators, thus quantifying the effects of dCas9-KRAB-mediated
    enhancer repression in single cells. Applying Mosaic-seq to 71 constituent enhancers
    from 15 super-enhancers, our analysis of 51,448 sgRNA-induced transcriptomes finds
    that only a small number of constituents are major effectors of target gene expression.
    Binding of p300 and RNAPII are key features of these constituents. We determine
    two key parameters of enhancer activity in single cells: their penetrance in a
    population and their contribution to expression in these cells. Through combinatorial
    interrogation, we find that simultaneous repression of multiple weak constituents
    can alter super-enhancer activity in a manner greatly exceeding repression of
    individual constituents.'

  volume: '50'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: ZNF143 is a ubiquitously expressed transcription factor conserved in vertebrates
    and might regulate the expression of numerous genes. But its function in mediating
    chromatin interactions remains elusive. By integrated analysis of public datasets,
    we provided evidence that a majority of ZNF143 binding sites (BSs) were involved
    in CTCF-mediated chromatin interaction networks (CTCF-CINs) by overlapping with
    cohesin-BSs and CTCF-BSs. We further showed that only a very few CTCF-CINs were
    associated with ZNF143 alone, whereas those associated with ZNF143 and cohesin
    simultaneously were highly overlapped with constitutive, conserved CTCF-BSs and
    enriched at boundaries of chromatin topologically associating domains. These observations
    implicate that as an important partner of CTCF, ZNF143 helps it establish the
    conserved chromatin structure by cooperating with cohesin.

    and CTCF a transition zones
  abstract: Long-range regulatory interactions play an important role in shaping gene-expression
    programs. However, the genomic features that organize these activities are still
    poorly characterized. We conducted a large operational analysis to chart the distribution
    of gene regulatory activities along the mouse genome, using hundreds of insertions
    of a regulatory sensor. We found that enhancers distribute their activities along
    broad regions and not in a gene-centric manner, defining large regulatory domains.
    Remarkably, these domains correlate strongly with the recently described TADs,
    which partition the genome into distinct self-interacting blocks. Different features,
    including specific repeats and CTCF-binding sites, correlate with the transition
    zones separating regulatory domains, and may help to further organize promiscuously
    distributed regulatory influences within large domains. These findings support
    a model of genomic organization where TADs confine regulatory activities to specific
    but large regulatory domains, contributing to the establishment of specific gene
    expression profiles.

  abstract: The study of genomic interactions has been greatly facilitated by techniques
    such as chromatin conformation capture with high-throughput sequencing (Hi-C).
    These genome-wide experiments generate large amounts of data that require careful
    analysis to obtain useful biological conclusions. However, development of the
    appropriate software tools is hindered by the lack of basic infrastructure to
    represent and manipulate genomic interaction data. Here, we present the InteractionSet
    package that provides classes to represent genomic interactions and store their
    associated experimental data, along with the methods required for low-level manipulation
    and processing of those classes. The InteractionSet package exploits existing
    infrastructure in the open-source Bioconductor project, while in turn being used
    by Bioconductor packages designed for higher-level analyses. For new packages,
    use of the functionality in InteractionSet will simplify development, allow access
    to more features and improve interoperability between packages.

  title: Orthologs, paralogs, and evolutionary genomics.
  container-title: Annual review of genetics
  page: '309-338'
  volume: '39'
  abstract: Orthologs and paralogs are two fundamentally different types of homologous
    genes that evolved, respectively, by vertical descent from a single ancestral
    gene and by duplication. Orthology and paralogy are key concepts of evolutionary
    genomics. A clear distinction between orthologs and paralogs is critical for the
    construction of a robust evolutionary classification of genes and reliable functional
    annotation of newly sequenced genomes. Genome comparisons show that orthologous
    relationships with genes from taxonomically distant species can be established
    for the majority of the genes from each sequenced genome. This review examines
    in depth the definitions and subtypes of orthologs and paralogs, outlines the
    principal methodological approaches employed for identification of orthology and
    paralogy, and considers evolutionary and functional implications of these concepts.

  abstract: As long as a square non-negative matrix A has total support then it can
    be balanced, that is, we can find a diagonal scaling of A that has row and column
    sums equal to one. A number of algorithms have been proposed to achieve the balancing,
    the most well known of these being Sinkhorn-Knopp. In this paper, we derive new
    algorithms based on inner-outer iteration schemes. We show that Sinkhorn-Knopp
    belongs to this family, but other members can converge much more quickly. In particular,
    we show that while stationary iterative methods offer little or no improvement
    in many cases, a scheme using a preconditioned conjugate gradient method as the
    inner iteration converges at much lower cost (in terms of matrix-vector products)
    for a broad range of matrices; and succeeds in cases where the Sinkhorn-Knopp
    algorithm fails.

  title: Mechanisms for human genomic rearrangements
  container-title: PathoGenetics
  publisher: BioMed Central
  page: '4'
  volume: '1'
  issue: '1'
  abstract: 'Genomic rearrangements describe gross DNA changes of the size ranging
    from a couple of hundred base pairs, the size of an average exon, to megabases
    (Mb). When greater than 3 to 5 Mb, such changes are usually visible microscopically
    by chromosome studies. Human diseases that result from genomic rearrangements
    have been called genomic disorders. Three major mechanisms have been proposed
    for genomic rearrangements in the human genome. Non-allelic homologous recombination
    (NAHR) is mostly mediated by low-copy repeats (LCRs) with recombination hotspots,
    gene conversion and apparent minimal efficient processing segments. NAHR accounts
    for most of the recurrent rearrangements: those that share a common size, show
    clustering of breakpoints, and recur in multiple individuals. Non-recurrent rearrangements
    are of different sizes in each patient, but may share a smallest region of overlap
    whose change in copy number may result in shared clinical features among different
    patients. LCRs do not mediate, but may stimulate non-recurrent events. Some rare
    NAHRs can also be mediated by highly homologous repetitive sequences (for example,
    Alu, LINE); these NAHRs account for some of the non-recurrent rearrangements.
    Other non-recurrent rearrangements can be explained by non-homologous end-joining
    (NHEJ) and the Fork Stalling and Template Switching (FoSTeS) models. These mechanisms
    occur both in germ cells, where the rearrangements can be associated with genomic
    disorders, and in somatic cells in which such genomic rearrangements can cause
    disorders such as cancer. NAHR, NHEJ and FoSTeS probably account for the majority
    of genomic rearrangements in our genome and the frequency distribution of the
    three at a given locus may partially reflect the genomic architecture in proximity
    to that locus. We provide a review of the current understanding of these three
    models.'

  abstract: Eukaryotic chromosomes are a highly organized three-dimensional entity
    folded through a tightly regulated process1,2 with important functions that include
    bringing distal regulatory elements into the vicinity of their target gene promoters
    and arranging the chromosomes into distinct compartments3–6. Recent technological
    innovations, including chromosome conformation capture carbon copy (5C), Hi-C
    and chromatin interaction analysis by paired-end tag sequencing (ChIA-PET), have
    facilitated the discovery of chromosomal organization principles and folding architectures
    at unprecedented scales and resolution. Each technology also comes with corresponding
    computational tools7,8 to process and visualize its specific data type. However,
    visualizing and navigating long-range interaction data, as well as integrating
    these interactions with other epigenomics data, remains a much-desired capability
    and a daunting challenge9.

  title: Formation of Chromosomal Domains by Loop Extrusion
  container-title: Cell Reports
  publisher: The Author(s)
  page: '2038-2049'
  volume: '15'
  issue: '9'
  abstract: Topologically associating domains (TADs) are fundamental structural and
    functional building blocks of human interphase chromosomes, yet the mechanisms
    of TAD formation remain unclear. Here, we propose that loop extrusion underlies
    TAD formation. In this process, cis-acting loop-extruding factors, likely cohesins,
    form progressively larger loops but stall at TAD boundaries due to interactions
    with boundary proteins, including CTCF. Using polymer simulations, we show that
    this model produces TADs and finer-scale features of Hi-C data. Each TAD emerges
    from multiple loops dynamically formed through extrusion, contrary to typical
    illustrations of single static loops. Loop extrusion both explains diverse experimental
    observations-including the preferential orientation of CTCF motifs, enrichments
    of architectural proteins at TAD boundaries, and boundary deletion experiments-and
    makes specific predictions for the depletion of CTCF versus cohesin. Finally,
    loop extrusion has potentially far-ranging consequences for processes such as
    enhancer-promoter interactions, orientation-specific chromosomal looping, and
    compaction of mitotic chromosomes.

  abstract: Copy number variation (CNV) is a source of genetic diversity in humans.
    Numerous CNVs are being identified with various genome analysis platforms, including
    array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH), single nucleotide polymorphism
    (SNP) genotyping platforms, and next-generation sequencing. CNV formation occurs
    by both recombination-based and replication-based mechanisms and de novo locus-specific
    mutation rates appear much higher for CNVs than for SNPs. By various molecular
    mechanisms, including gene dosage, gene disruption, gene fusion, position effects,
    etc., CNVs can cause Mendelian or sporadic traits, or be associated with complex
    diseases. However, CNV can also represent benign polymorphic variants. CNVs, especially
    gene duplication and exon shuffling, can be a predominant mechanism driving gene
    and genome evolution.

  annote: \- ultraconserved enhancers are required for normal development - knowck-out
    mice that lack individual or combination of enhancers - mice with singel or multipel
    loss of enhancers showed neurological phenotypes, but viable
  abstract: Non-coding "ultraconserved" regions containing hundreds of consecutive
    bases of perfect sequence conservation across mammalian genomes can function as
    distant-acting enhancers. However, initial deletion studies in mice revealed that
    loss of such extraordinarily constrained sequences had no immediate impact on
    viability. Here, we show that ultraconserved enhancers are required for normal
    development. Focusing on some of the longest ultraconserved sites genome wide,
    located near the essential neuronal transcription factor Arx, we used genome editing
    to create an expanded series of knockout mice lacking individual or combinations
    of ultraconserved enhancers. Mice with single or pairwise deletions of ultraconserved
    enhancers were viable and fertile but in nearly all cases showed neurological
    or growth abnormalities, including substantial alterations of neuron populations
    and structural brain defects. Our results demonstrate the functional importance
    of ultraconserved enhancers and indicate that remarkably strong sequence conservation
    likely results from fitness deficits that appear subtle in a laboratory setting.

    to clustering approaches for ortholog prediction, showing a large increase in
    coverage using the phylogenetic approach. All data are made available in a number
    of formats and will be kept up to date with the Ensembl project.

  container-title: PeerJ
  page: 'e3742'
  volume: '5'
  abstract: \<p\>We have developed a machine learning approach to predict stimulation-dependent
    enhancer-promoter interactions using evidence from changes in genomic protein
    occupancy over time. The occupancy of estrogen receptor alpha (ER$\alpha$), RNA
    polymerase (Pol II) and histone marks H2AZ and H3K4me3 were measured over time
    using ChIP-Seq experiments in MCF7 cells stimulated with estrogen. A Bayesian
    classifier was developed which uses the correlation of temporal binding patterns
    at enhancers and promoters and genomic proximity as features to predict interactions.
    This method was trained using experimentally determined interactions from the
    same system and was shown to achieve much higher precision than predictions based
    on the genomic proximity of nearest ER$\alpha$ binding. We use the method to identify
    a genome-wide confident set of ER$\alpha$ target genes and their regulatory enhancers
    genome-wide. Validation with publicly available GRO-Seq data demonstrates that
    our predicted targets are much more likely to show early nascent transcription
    than predictions based on genomic ER$\alpha$ binding proximity alone.\</p\>

  title: LBR and lamin A/C sequentially tether peripheral heterochromatin and inversely
    regulate differentiation.
  container-title: Cell
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: '584-98'
  volume: '152'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: 'Eukaryotic cells have a layer of heterochromatin at the nuclear periphery.
    To investigate mechanisms regulating chromatin distribution, we analyzed heterochromatin
    organization in different tissues and species, including mice with mutations in
    the lamin B receptor (Lbr) and lamin A (Lmna) genes that encode nuclear envelope
    (NE) proteins. We identified LBR- and lamin-A/C-dependent mechanisms tethering
    heterochromatin to the NE. The two tethers are sequentially used during cellular
    differentiation and development: first the LBR- and then the lamin-A/C-dependent
    tether. The absence of both LBR and lamin A/C leads to loss of peripheral heterochromatin
    and an inverted architecture with heterochromatin localizing to the nuclear interior.
    Myoblast transcriptome analyses indicated that selective disruption of the LBR-
    or lamin-A-dependent heterochromatin tethers have opposite effects on muscle gene
    expression, either increasing or decreasing, respectively. These results show
    how changes in NE composition contribute to regulating heterochromatin positioning,
    gene expression, and cellular differentiation during development.'

  title: From pull-down data to protein interaction networks and complexes with biological
    relevance.
  container-title: Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)
  page: '979-86'
  volume: '24'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: 'MOTIVATION: Recent improvements in high-throughput Mass Spectrometry
    (MS) technology have expedited genome-wide discovery of protein-protein interactions
    by providing a capability of detecting protein complexes in a physiological setting.
    Computational inference of protein interaction networks and protein complexes
    from MS data are challenging. Advances are required in developing robust and seamlessly
    integrated procedures for assessment of protein-protein interaction affinities,
    mathematical representation of protein interaction networks, discovery of protein
    complexes and evaluation of their biological relevance. RESULTS: A multi-step
    but easy-to-follow framework for identifying protein complexes from MS pull-down
    data is introduced. It assesses interaction affinity between two proteins based
    on similarity of their co-purification patterns derived from MS data. It constructs
    a protein interaction network by adopting a knowledge-guided threshold selection
    method. Based on the network, it identifies protein complexes and infers their
    core components using a graph-theoretical approach. It deploys a statistical evaluation
    procedure to assess biological relevance of each found complex. On Saccharomyces
    cerevisiae pull-down data, the framework outperformed other more complicated schemes
    by at least 10% in F(1)-measure and identified 610 protein complexes with high-functional
    homogeneity based on the enrichment in Gene Ontology (GO) annotation. Manual examination
    of the complexes brought forward the hypotheses on cause of false identifications.
    Namely, co-purification of different protein complexes as mediated by a common
    non-protein molecule, such as DNA, might be a source of false positives. Protein
    identification bias in pull-down technology, such as the hydrophilic bias could
    result in false negatives.'

  annote: Hi-C during cell-cycle
  abstract: Mitotic chromosomes are among the most recognizable structures in the
    cell, yet for over a century their internal organization remains largely unsolved.
    We applied chromosome conformation capture methods, 5C and Hi-C, across the cell
    cycle and revealed two distinct three-dimensional folding states of the human
    genome. We show that the highly compartmentalized and cell type-specific organization
    described previously for nonsynchronous cells is restricted to interphase. In
    metaphase, we identified a homogenous folding state that is locus-independent,
    common to all chromosomes, and consistent among cell types, suggesting a general
    principle of metaphase chromosome organization. Using polymer simulations, we
    found that metaphase Hi-C data are inconsistent with classic hierarchical models
    and are instead best described by a linearly organized longitudinally compressed
    array of consecutive chromatin loops.

  title: Polymerase $\epsilon$1 mutation in a human syndrome with facial dysmorphism,

  container-title: The Journal of experimental medicine
  publisher: Rockefeller University Press
  page: '2323-30'
  volume: '209'
  issue: '13'
  abstract: DNA polymerase $\epsilon$ (Pol$\epsilon$) is a large, four-subunit polymerase
    that is conserved throughout the eukaryotes. Its primary function is to synthesize
    DNA at the leading strand during replication. It is also involved in a wide variety
    of fundamental cellular processes, including cell cycle progression and DNA repair/recombination.
    Here, we report that a homozygous single base pair substitution in POLE1 (polymerase
    $\epsilon$ 1), encoding the catalytic subunit of Pol$\epsilon$, caused facial
    dysmorphism, immunodeficiency, livedo, and short stature ("FILS syndrome") in
    a large, consanguineous family. The mutation resulted in alternative splicing
    in the conserved region of intron 34, which strongly decreased protein expression
    of Pol$\epsilon$1 and also to a lesser extent the Pol$\epsilon$2 subunit. We observed
    impairment in proliferation and G1- to S-phase progression in patients’ T lymphocytes.
    Pol$\epsilon$1 depletion also impaired G1- to S-phase progression in B lymphocytes,
    chondrocytes, and osteoblasts. Our results evidence the developmental impact of
    a Pol$\epsilon$ catalytic subunit deficiency in humans and its causal relationship
    with a newly recognized, inherited disorder.

  title: Master transcription factors and mediator establish super-enhancers at key
    cell identity genes.
  container-title: Cell
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: '307-19'
  volume: '153'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Master transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog bind enhancer elements
    and recruit Mediator to activate much of the gene expression program of pluripotent
    embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We report here that the ESC master transcription
    factors form unusual enhancer domains at most genes that control the pluripotent
    state. These domains, which we call super-enhancers, consist of clusters of enhancers
    that are densely occupied by the master regulators and Mediator. Super-enhancers
    differ from typical enhancers in size, transcription factor density and content,
    ability to activate transcription, and sensitivity to perturbation. Reduced levels
    of Oct4 or Mediator cause preferential loss of expression of super-enhancer-associated
    genes relative to other genes, suggesting how changes in gene expression programs
    might be accomplished during development. In other more differentiated cells,
    super-enhancers containing cell-type-specific master transcription factors are
    also found at genes that define cell identity. Super-enhancers thus play key roles
    in the control of mammalian cell identity.

  page: '773-82'
  volume: '49'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Mammalian genomes encode genetic information in their linear sequence,
    but appropriate expression of their genes requires chromosomes to fold into complex
    three-dimensional structures. Transcriptional control involves the establishment
    of physical connections among genes and regulatory elements, both along and between
    chromosomes. Recent technological innovations in probing the folding of chromosomes
    are providing new insights into the spatial organization of genomes and its role
    in gene regulation. It is emerging that folding of large complex chromosomes involves
    a hierarchy of structures, from chromatin loops that connect genes and enhancers
    to larger chromosomal domains and nuclear compartments. The larger these structures
    are along this hierarchy, the more stable they are within cells, while becoming
    more stochastic between cells. Here, we review the experimental and theoretical
    data on this hierarchy of structures and propose a key role for the recently discovered
    topologically associating domains.

  abstract: We describe an approach to detect the frequency of interaction between
    any two genomic loci. Generation of a matrix of interaction frequencies between
    sites on the same or different chromosomes reveals their relative spatial disposition
    and provides information about the physical properties of the chromatin fiber.
    This methodology can be applied to the spatial organization of entire genomes
    in organisms from bacteria to human. Using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
    we could confirm known qualitative features of chromosome organization within
    the nucleus and dynamic changes in that organization during meiosis. We also analyzed
    yeast chromosome III at the G1 stage of the cell cycle. We found that chromatin
    is highly flexible throughout. Furthermore, functionally distinct AT- and GC-rich
    domains were found to exhibit different conformations, and a population-average
    3D model of chromosome III could be determined. Chromosome III emerges as a contorted
    ring.

  abstract: Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with next-generation sequencing
    (ChIP-seq) is a powerful technology to identify the genome-wide locations of transcription
    factors and other DNA binding proteins. Computational ChIP-seq peak calling infers
    the location of protein-DNA interactions based on various measures of enrichment

    of the quadratic enrichment of reads to center candidate peaks followed by statistical
    analysis of saturation of candidate peaks by 5’ ends of reads. We show that our
    method not only is substantially faster than several competing methods but also
    demonstrates statistically significant advantages with respect to reproducibility
    of results and in its ability to identify peaks with reproducible binding site
    motifs. We show that Q has superior performance in the delineation of double RNAPII
    and H3K4me3 peaks surrounding transcription start sites related to a better ability
    to resolve individual peaks. The method is implemented in C++ and is freely available
    under an open source license.

  title: Divergence in the spatial pattern of gene expression between human duplicate
    genes.
  container-title: Genome research
  page: '1638-1645'
  volume: '13'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: Microarray gene expression data provide a wealth of information for elucidating
    the mode and tempo of molecular evolution. In the present study,we analyze the
    spatial expression pattern of human duplicate gene pairs by using oligonucleotide
    microarray data,and study the relationship between coding sequence divergence
    and expression divergence. First,we find a strong positive correlation between
    the proportion of duplicate gene pairs with divergent expression (as presence
    or absence of expression in a tissue) and both synonymous (K(S)) and nonsynonymous
    divergence (K(A)). The divergence of gene expression between human duplicate genes
    is rapid, probably faster than that between yeast duplicates in terms of generations.
    Second,we compute the correlation coefficient (R) between the expression levels
    of duplicate genes in different tissues and find a significant negative correlation
    between R and K(S). There is also a negative correlation between R and K(A), when
    K(A) \<or= 0.2. These results indicate that protein sequence divergence and divergence
    of spatial expression pattern are initially coupled. Finally,we compare the functions
    of those duplicate genes that show rapid divergence in spatial expression pattern
    with the functions of those duplicate genes that show no or little divergence
    in spatial expression.

  title: A novel 6C assay uncovers Polycomb-mediated higher order chromatin conformations.
  container-title: Genome research
  page: '1171-9'
  volume: '18'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: We describe construction of a novel modification, "6C," of chromatin looping
    assays that allows specific proteins that may mediate long-range chromatin interactions
    to be defined. This approach combines the standard looping approaches previously
    defined with an immunoprecipitation step to investigate involvement of the specific
    protein. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by using a Polycomb group
    (PcG) protein, Enhancer of Zeste (EZH2), as an example of how our assay might
    be used. EZH2, as a protein of the PcG complex, PRC2, has an important role in
    the propagation of epigenetic memory through deposition of the repressive mark,
    histone H3, lysine 27, tri-methylation (H3K27me3). Using our new 6C assay, we
    show how EZH2 is a direct mediator of long-range intra- and interchromosomal interactions
    that can regulate transcriptional down-regulation of multiple genes by facilitating
    physical proximities between distant chromatin regions, thus targeting sites within
    to PcG machinery.

  title: Spatial partitioning of the regulatory landscape of the X-inactivation centre.
  container-title: Nature
  page: '381-5'
  volume: '485'
  issue: '7398'
  abstract: In eukaryotes transcriptional regulation often involves multiple long-range
    elements and is influenced by the genomic environment. A prime example of this
    concerns the mouse X-inactivation centre (Xic), which orchestrates the initiation
    of X-chromosome inactivation (XCI) by controlling the expression of the non-protein-coding
    Xist transcript. The extent of Xic sequences required for the proper regulation
    of Xist remains unknown. Here we use chromosome conformation capture carbon-copy
    (5C) and super-resolution microscopy to analyse the spatial organization of a
    4.5-megabases (Mb) region including Xist. We discover a series of discrete 200-kilobase
    to 1 Mb topologically associating domains (TADs), present both before and after
    cell differentiation and on the active and inactive X. TADs align with, but do
    not rely on, several domain-wide features of the epigenome, such as H3K27me3 or
    H3K9me2 blocks and lamina-associated domains. TADs also align with coordinately
    regulated gene clusters. Disruption of a TAD boundary causes ectopic chromosomal
    contacts and long-range transcriptional misregulation. The Xist/Tsix sense/antisense
    unit illustrates how TADs enable the spatial segregation of oppositely regulated
    chromosomal neighbourhoods, with the respective promoters of Xist and Tsix lying
    in adjacent TADs, each containing their known positive regulators. We identify
    a novel distal regulatory region of Tsix within its TAD, which produces a long
    intervening RNA, Linx. In addition to uncovering a new principle of cis-regulatory
    architecture of mammalian chromosomes, our study sets the stage for the full genetic
    dissection of the X-inactivation centre.

  abstract: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq) assays identify
    where proteins bind throughout a genome. However, DNA contamination and DNA fragmentation
    heterogeneity produce false positives (erroneous calls) and imprecision in mapping.
    Consequently, stringent data filtering produces false negatives (missed calls).
    Here we describe ChIP-exo, where an exonuclease trims ChIP DNA to a precise distance
    from the crosslinking site. Bound locations are detectable as peak pairs by deep
    sequencing. Contaminating DNA is degraded or fails to form complementary peak
    pairs. With the single bp accuracy provided by ChIP-exo, we show an unprecedented
    view into genome-wide binding of the yeast transcription factors Reb1, Gal4, Phd1,
    Rap1, and human CTCF. Each of these factors was chosen to address potential limitations
    of ChIP-exo. We found that binding sites become unambiguous and reveal diverse
    tendencies governing in vivo DNA-binding specificity that include sequence variants,
    functionally distinct motifs, motif clustering, secondary interactions, and combinatorial
    modules within a compound motif.

  annote: \- Comparison of human and mouse genome by whole-genome alignemnt - many
    smal rearrangments - discusses levels in net files
  abstract: This study examines genomic duplications, deletions, and rearrangements
    that have happened at scales ranging from a single base to complete chromosomes
    by comparing the mouse and human genomes. From whole-genome sequence alignments,
    344 large (\>100-kb) blocks of conserved synteny are evident, but these are further
    fragmented by smaller-scale evolutionary events. Excluding transposon insertions,
    on average in each megabase of genomic alignment we observe two inversions, 17
    duplications (five tandem or nearly tandem), seven transpositions, and 200 deletions
    of 100 bases or more. This includes 160 inversions and 75 duplications or transpositions
    of length \>100 kb. The frequencies of these smaller events are not substantially
    higher in finished portions in the assembly. Many of the smaller transpositions
    are processed pseudogenes; we define a "syntenic" subset of the alignments that
    excludes these and other small-scale transpositions. These alignments provide
    evidence that approximately 2% of the genes in the human/mouse common ancestor
    have been deleted or partially deleted in the mouse. There also appears to be
    slightly less nontransposon-induced genome duplication in the mouse than in the
    human lineage. Although some of the events we detect are possibly due to misassemblies
    or missing data in the current genome sequence or to the limitations of our methods,
    most are likely to represent genuine evolutionary events. To make these observations,
    we developed new alignment techniques that can handle large gaps in a robust fashion
    and discriminate between orthologous and paralogous alignments.

  container-title: Cell
  publisher: Elsevier Inc.
  page: '1665-80'
  volume: '159'
  issue: '7'
  abstract: We use in situ Hi-C to probe the 3D architecture of genomes, constructing
    haploid and diploid maps of nine cell types. The densest, in human lymphoblastoid
    cells, contains 4.9 billion contacts, achieving 1 kb resolution. We find that
    genomes are partitioned into contact domains (median length, 185 kb), which are
    associated with distinct patterns of histone marks and segregate into six subcompartments.
    We identify ∼10,000 loops. These loops frequently link promoters and enhancers,
    correlate with gene activation, and show conservation across cell types and species.
    Loop anchors typically occur at domain boundaries and bind CTCF. CTCF sites at
    loop anchors occur predominantly (\>90%) in a convergent orientation, with the
    asymmetric motifs "facing" one another. The inactive X chromosome splits into
    two massive domains and contains large loops anchored at CTCF-binding repeats.

  container-title: The American Journal of Human Genetics
  publisher: Cell Press
  page: '340-348'
  volume: '76'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: Although somatic mutations in a number of genes have been associated with
    development of human tumors, such as lipomas, relatively few examples exist of
    germline mutations in these genes. Here we describe an 8-year-old boy who has
    a de novo pericentric inversion of chromosome 12, with breakpoints at p11.22 and
    q14.3, and a phenotype including extreme somatic overgrowth, advanced endochondral
    bone and dental ages, a cerebellar tumor, and multiple lipomas. His chromosomal
    inversion was found to truncate HMGA2, a gene that encodes an architectural factor
    involved in the etiology of many benign mesenchymal tumors and that maps to the
    12q14.3 breakpoint. Similar truncations of murine Hmga2 in transgenic mice result
    in somatic overgrowth and, in particular, increased abundance of fat and lipomas,
    features strikingly similar to those observed in the child. This represents the
    first report of a constitutional rearrangement affecting HMGA2 and demonstrates
    the role of this gene in human growth and development. Systematic genetic analysis
    and clinical studies of this child may offer unique insights into the role of
    HMGA2 in adipogenesis, osteogenesis, and general growth control.

  container-title: The American Journal of Human Genetics
  page: '671-679'
  volume: '78'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Transposable genetic elements are abundant in the genomes of most organisms,
    including humans. These endogenous mutagens can alter genes, promote genomic rearrangements,
    and may help to drive the speciation of organisms. In this study, we identified
    almost 11,000 transposon copies that are differentially present in the human and
    chimpanzee genomes. Most of these transposon copies were mobilized after the existence
    of a common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees, approximately 6 million years
    ago. Alu, L1, and SVA insertions accounted for \>95% of the insertions in both
    species. Our data indicate that humans have supported higher levels of transposition
    than have chimpanzees during the past several million years and have amplified
    different transposon subfamilies. In both species, approximately 34% of the insertions
    were located within known genes. These insertions represent a form of species-specific
    genetic variation that may have contributed to the differential evolution of humans
    and chimpanzees. In addition to providing an initial overview of recently mobilized
    elements, our collections will be useful for assessing the impact of these insertions
    on their hosts and for studying the transposition mechanisms of these elements.

  abstract: Cellular development, morphology and function are governed by precise
    patterns of gene expression. These are established by the coordinated action of
    genomic regulatory elements known as enhancers or cis-regulatory modules. More
    than 30 years after the initial discovery of enhancers, many of their properties
    have been elucidated; however, despite major efforts, we only have an incomplete
    picture of enhancers in animal genomes. In this Review, we discuss how properties
    of enhancer sequences and chromatin are used to predict enhancers in genome-wide
    studies. We also cover recently developed high-throughput methods that allow the
    direct testing and identification of enhancers on the basis of their activity.
    Finally, we discuss recent technological advances and current challenges in the
    field of regulatory genomics.

  abstract: Understanding the topological configurations of chromatin may reveal valuable
    insights into how the genome and epigenome act in concert to control cell fate
    during development. Here, we generate high-resolution architecture maps across
    seven genomic loci in embryonic stem cells and neural progenitor cells. We observe
    a hierarchy of 3D interactions that undergo marked reorganization at the submegabase
    scale during differentiation. Distinct combinations of CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF),
    Mediator, and cohesin show widespread enrichment in chromatin interactions at
    different length scales. CTCF/cohesin anchor long-range constitutive interactions
    that might form the topological basis for invariant subdomains. Conversely, Mediator/cohesin
    bridge short-range enhancer-promoter interactions within and between larger subdomains.
    Knockdown of Smc1 or Med12 in embryonic stem cells results in disruption of spatial
    architecture and downregulation of genes found in cohesin-mediated interactions.
    We conclude that cell-type-specific chromatin organization occurs at the submegabase
    scale and that architectural proteins shape the genome in hierarchical length
    scales.

  abstract: Structural variation of the genome involves kilobase- to megabase-sized
    deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions, and complex combinations of rearrangements.
    We introduce high-throughput and massive paired-end mapping (PEM), a large-scale
    genome-sequencing method to identify structural variants (SVs) approximately 3
    kilobases (kb) or larger that combines the rescue and capture of paired ends of
    3-kb fragments, massive 454 sequencing, and a computational approach to map DNA
    reads onto a reference genome. PEM was used to map SVs in an African and in a
    putatively European individual and identified shared and divergent SVs relative
    to the reference genome. Overall, we fine-mapped more than 1000 SVs and documented
    that the number of SVs among humans is much larger than initially hypothesized;
    many of the SVs potentially affect gene function. The breakpoint junction sequences
    of more than 200 SVs were determined with a novel pooling strategy and computational
    analysis. Our analysis provided insights into the mechanisms of SV formation in
    humans.

  page: '580-587'
  volume: '89'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: In studies of their transcriptional activity, genomes have shown a high
    order of organization. We assessed the question of how genomically neighboring
    genes are transcriptionally coupled across tissues and what could be the driving
    force behind their coupling. We focused our analysis on the transcriptome information
    for 13 tissues of Mus musculus and 79 tissues of Homo sapiens. The analysis of
    coexpression patterns of genomically adjacent genes across tissues revealed 2619
    and 1275 clusters of highly coexpressed genes, respectively. Most of these clusters
    consist of pairs and triplets of genes. They span a limited genomic length and
    are phylogenetically conserved between human and mouse. These clusters consist
    mainly of nonparalogous genes and show a decreased functional and similar regulatory
    relationship to one another compared to general genomic neighbors. We hypothesize
    that these clusters trace back to large-scale, qualitative, persistent reorganizations
    of the transcriptome, while transcription factor regulation is likely to handle
    fine-tuning of transcription on shorter time scales. Our data point to so far
    uncharacterized cis-acting units and reject cofunctionality as a driving force.

  title: Polycomb-dependent regulatory contacts between distant Hox loci in Drosophila.
  container-title: Cell
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: '214-26'
  volume: '144'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: In Drosophila melanogaster, Hox genes are organized in an anterior and
    a posterior cluster, called Antennapedia complex and bithorax complex, located
    on the same chromosome arm and separated by 10 Mb of DNA. Both clusters are repressed
    by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. Here, we show that genes of the two Hox complexes
    can interact within nuclear PcG bodies in tissues where they are corepressed.
    This colocalization increases during development and depends on PcG proteins.
    Hox gene contacts are conserved in the distantly related Drosophila virilis species
    and they are part of a large gene interaction network that includes other PcG
    target genes. Importantly, mutations on one of the loci weaken silencing of genes
    in the other locus, resulting in the exacerbation of homeotic phenotypes in sensitized
    genetic backgrounds. Thus, the three-dimensional organization of Polycomb target
    genes in the cell nucleus stabilizes the maintenance of epigenetic gene silencing.

  abstract: Protein function is often modulated by protein-protein interactions (PPIs)
    and therefore defining the partners of a protein helps to understand its activity.
    PPIs can be detected through different experimental approaches and are collected
    in several expert curated databases. These databases are used by researchers interested
    in examining detailed information on particular proteins. In many analyses the
    reliability of the characterization of the interactions becomes important and
    it might be necessary to select sets of PPIs of different confidence levels. To
    this goal, we generated HIPPIE (Human Integrated Protein-Protein Interaction rEference),
    a human PPI dataset with a normalized scoring scheme that integrates multiple
    experimental PPI datasets. HIPPIE’s scoring scheme has been optimized by human
    experts and a computer algorithm to reflect the amount and quality of evidence
    for a given PPI and we show that these scores correlate to the quality of the
    experimental characterization. The HIPPIE web tool (available at http://cbdm.mdc-berlin.de/tools/hippie)
    allows researchers to do network analyses focused on likely true PPI sets by generating
    subnetworks around proteins of interest at a specified confidence level.

  title: HERC2 rs12913832 modulates human pigmentation by attenuating chromatin-loop
    formation between a long-range enhancer and the OCA2 promoter.
  container-title: Genome research
  publisher: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press
  page: '446-55'
  volume: '22'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Pigmentation of skin, eye, and hair reflects some of the most evident
    common phenotypes in humans. Several candidate genes for human pigmentation are
    identified. The SNP rs12913832 has strong statistical association with human pigmentation.
    It is located within an intron of the nonpigment gene HERC2, 21 kb upstream of
    the pigment gene OCA2, and the region surrounding rs12913832 is highly conserved
    among animal species. However, the exact functional role of HERC2 rs12913832 in
    human pigmentation is unknown. Here we demonstrate that the HERC2 rs12913832 region
    functions as an enhancer regulating OCA2 transcription. In darkly pigmented human
    melanocytes carrying the rs12913832 T-allele, we detected binding of the transcription
    factors HLTF, LEF1, and MITF to the HERC2 rs12913832 enhancer, and a long-range
    chromatin loop between this enhancer and the OCA2 promoter that leads to elevated
    OCA2 expression. In contrast, in lightly pigmented melanocytes carrying the rs12913832
    C-allele, chromatin-loop formation, transcription factor recruitment, and OCA2
    expression are all reduced. Hence, we demonstrate that allelic variation of a
    common noncoding SNP located in a distal regulatory element not only disrupts
    the regulatory potential of this element but also affects its interaction with
    the relevant promoter. We provide the key mechanistic insight that allele-dependent
    differences in chromatin-loop formation (i.e., structural differences in the folding
    of gene loci) result in differences in allelic gene expression that affects common
    phenotypic traits. This concept is highly relevant for future studies aiming to
    unveil the functional basis of genetically determined phenotypes, including diseases.

  abstract: Recent advances leave no doubt that higher order chromatin structures
    play a fundamental role in many developmentally important mechanisms of gene regulation.
    In particular analyses in genetic model systems like yeast andDrosophilauncovered
    novel proteins that are involved in the regulation of chromatin structures. Many
    of these proteins do not bind directly to DNA but interact in large multimeric
    complexes. To identify the DNA elements regulated by these multiprotein complexes,
    alternative approaches to the standard methods of DNA–protein analysis had to
    be devised. Here we present a method that preserves the architecture of the higher
    order chromatin structures by cross-linking cellsin vivowith formaldehyde. An
    immunoprecipitation strategy is then used to identify the DNA targets of chromosomal
    proteins of interest. This method can be applied to study the distribution of
    proteins at high resolution over extended chromosomal regions.

  abstract: Chromosome territories (CTs) constitute a major feature of nuclear architecture.
    In a brief statement, the possible contribution of nuclear architecture studies
    to the field of epigenomics is considered, followed by a historical account of
    the CT concept and the final compelling experimental evidence of a territorial
    organization of chromosomes in all eukaryotes studied to date. Present knowledge
    of nonrandom CT arrangements, of the internal CT architecture, and of structural
    interactions with other CTs is provided as well as the dynamics of CT arrangements
    during cell cycle and postmitotic terminal differentiation. The article concludes
    with a discussion of open questions and new experimental strategies to answer
    them.

  title: Disentangling the many layers of eukaryotic transcriptional regulation.
  container-title: Annual review of genetics
  page: '43-68'
  volume: '46'
  abstract: Regulation of gene expression in eukaryotes is an extremely complex process.
    In this review, we break down several critical steps, emphasizing new data and
    techniques that have expanded current gene regulatory models. We begin at the
    level of DNA sequence where cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) provide important regulatory
    information in the form of transcription factor (TF) binding sites. In this respect,
    CRMs function as instructional platforms for the assembly of gene regulatory complexes.
    We discuss multiple mechanisms controlling complex assembly, including cooperative
    DNA binding, combinatorial codes, and CRM architecture. The second section of
    this review places CRM assembly in the context of nucleosomes and condensed chromatin.
    We discuss how DNA accessibility and histone modifications contribute to TF function.
    Lastly, new advances in chromosomal mapping techniques have provided increased
    understanding of intra- and interchromosomal interactions. We discuss how these
    topological maps influence gene regulatory models.

  abstract: The spatial organization of the genome is intimately linked to its biological
    function, yet our understanding of higher order genomic structure is coarse, fragmented
    and incomplete. In the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, interphase chromosomes occupy
    distinct chromosome territories, and numerous models have been proposed for how
    chromosomes fold within chromosome territories. These models, however, provide
    only few mechanistic details about the relationship between higher order chromatin
    structure and genome function. Recent advances in genomic technologies have led
    to rapid advances in the study of three-dimensional genome organization. In particular,
    Hi-C has been introduced as a method for identifying higher order chromatin interactions
    genome wide. Here we investigate the three-dimensional organization of the human
    and mouse genomes in embryonic stem cells and terminally differentiated cell types
    at unprecedented resolution. We identify large, megabase-sized local chromatin
    interaction domains, which we term ’topological domains’, as a pervasive structural
    feature of the genome organization. These domains correlate with regions of the
    genome that constrain the spread of heterochromatin. The domains are stable across
    different cell types and highly conserved across species, indicating that topological
    domains are an inherent property of mammalian genomes. Finally, we find that the
    boundaries of topological domains are enriched for the insulator binding protein
    CTCF, housekeeping genes, transfer RNAs and short interspersed element (SINE)
    retrotransposons, indicating that these factors may have a role in establishing
    the topological domain structure of the genome.

  title: Explicit DNase sequence bias modeling enables high-resolution transcription
    factor footprint detection.
  container-title: Nucleic acids research
  page: '1-14'
  abstract: DNaseI footprinting is an established assay for identifying transcription
    factor (TF)-DNA interactions with single base pair resolution. High-throughput
    DNase-seq assays have recently been used to detect in vivo DNase footprints across
    the genome. Multiple computational approaches have been developed to identify
    DNase-seq footprints as predictors of TF binding. However, recent studies have
    pointed to a substantial cleavage bias of DNase and its negative impact on predictive
    performance of footprinting. To assess the potential for using DNase-seq to identify
    individual binding sites, we performed DNase-seq on deproteinized genomic DNA
    and determined sequence cleavage bias. This allowed us to build bias corrected
    and TF-specific footprint models. The predictive performance of these models demonstrated
    that predicted footprints corresponded to high-confidence TF-DNA interactions.
    DNase-seq footprints were absent under a fraction of ChIP-seq peaks, which we
    show to be indicative of weaker binding, indirect TF-DNA interactions or possible
    ChIP artifacts. The modeling approach was also able to detect variation in the
    consensus motifs that TFs bind to. Finally, cell type specific footprints were
    detected within DNase hypersensitive sites that are present in multiple cell types,
    further supporting that footprints can identify changes in TF binding that are
    not detectable using other strategies.

  title: 'Consensus Statement: Chromosomal Microarray Is a First-Tier Clinical Diagnostic
    Test for Individuals with Developmental Disabilities or Congenital Anomalies'
  container-title: The American Journal of Human Genetics
  publisher: Cell Press
  page: '749-764'
  volume: '86'
  issue: '5'
  abstract: Chromosomal microarray (CMA) is increasingly utilized for genetic testing
    of individuals with unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID),
    autism spectrum disorders (ASD), or multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). Performing
    CMA and G-banded karyotyping on every patient substantially increases the total
    cost of genetic testing. The International Standard Cytogenomic Array (ISCA) Consortium
    held two international workshops and conducted a literature review of 33 studies,
    including 21,698 patients tested by CMA. We provide an evidence-based summary
    of clinical cytogenetic testing comparing CMA to G-banded karyotyping with respect
    to technical advantages and limitations, diagnostic yield for various types of
    chromosomal aberrations, and issues that affect test interpretation. CMA offers
    a much higher diagnostic yield (15%–20%) for genetic testing of individuals with
    unexplained DD/ID, ASD, or MCA than a G-banded karyotype (∼3%, excluding Down
    syndrome and other recognizable chromosomal syndromes), primarily because of its
    higher sensitivity for submicroscopic deletions and duplications. Truly balanced
    rearrangements and low-level mosaicism are generally not detectable by arrays,
    but these are relatively infrequent causes of abnormal phenotypes in this population
    (\<1%). Available evidence strongly supports the use of CMA in place of G-banded
    karyotyping as the first-tier cytogenetic diagnostic test for patients with DD/ID,
    ASD, or MCA. G-banded karyotype analysis should be reserved for patients with
    obvious chromosomal syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome), a family history of chromosomal
    rearrangement, or a history of multiple miscarriages.

  abstract: The study of homeotic-transformation mutants in model organisms such as
    Drosophila revolutionized the field of developmental biology, but how these mutants
    relate to human developmental defects remains to be elucidated. Here, we show
    that Liebenberg syndrome, an autosomal-dominant upper-limb malformation, shows
    features of a homeotic limb transformation in which the arms have acquired morphological
    characteristics of a leg. Using high-resolution array comparative genomic hybridization
    and paired-end whole-genome sequencing, we identified two deletions and a translocation
    5’ of PITX1. The structural changes are likely to remove active PITX1 forelimb
    suppressor and/or insulator elements and thereby move active enhancer elements
    in the vicinity of the PITX1 regulatory landscape. We generated transgenic mice
    in which PITX1 was misexpressed under the control of a nearby enhancer and were
    able to recapitulate the Liebenberg phenotype.

  title: Long-range chromatin regulatory interactions in vivo
  container-title: Nat Genet
  page: '623-626'
  volume: '32'
  issue: '4'
  abstract: Communication between distal chromosomal elements is essential for control
    of many nuclear processes. For example, genes in higher eukaryotes often require
    distant enhancer sequences for high-level expression. The mechanisms proposed
    for long-range enhancer action fall into two basic categories. Non-contact models
    propose that enhancers act at a distance to create a favorable environment for
    gene transcription, or act as entry sites or nucleation points for factors that
    ultimately communicate with the gene. Contact models propose that communication
    occurs through direct interaction between the distant enhancer and the gene by
    various mechanisms that ’loop out’ the intervening sequences. Although much attention
    has focused on contact models, the existence and nature of long-range interactions
    is still controversial and speculative, as there is no direct evidence that distant
    sequences physically interact in vivo. Here, we report the development of a widely
    applicable in situ technique to tag and recover chromatin in the immediate vicinity
    of an actively transcribed gene. We show that the classical enhancer element,
    HS2 of the prototypical locus control region (LCR) of the beta-globin gene cluster,
    is in close physical proximity to an actively transcribed HBB (beta-globin) gene
    located over 50 kb away in vivo, suggesting a direct regulatory interaction. The
    results give unprecedented insight into the in vivo structure of the LCR-gene
    interface and provide the first direct evidence of long-range enhancer communication.

    solution for mapping interactions between genomic elements'
  container-title: Genome Research
  page: '1299-1309'
  volume: '16'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Physical interactions between genetic elements located throughout the
    genome play important roles in gene regulation and can be identified with the
    Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) methodology. 3C converts physical chromatin
    interactions into specific ligation products, which are quantified individually
    by PCR. Here we present a high-throughput 3C approach, 3C-Carbon Copy (5C), that
    employs microarrays or quantitative DNA sequencing using 454-technology as detection
    methods. We applied 5C to analyze a 400-kb region containing the human beta-globin
    locus and a 100-kb conserved gene desert region. We validated 5C by detection
    of several previously identified looping interactions in the beta-globin locus.
    We also identified a new looping interaction in K562 cells between the beta-globin
    Locus Control Region and the gamma-beta-globin intergenic region. Interestingly,
    this region has been implicated in the control of developmental globin gene switching.
    5C should be widely applicable for large-scale mapping of cis- and trans- interaction
    networks of genomic elements and for the study of higher-order chromosome structure.

  title: Unbiased analysis of potential targets of breast cancer susceptibility loci
    by Capture Hi-C.
  container-title: Genome research
  page: '1854-1868'
  abstract: Genome-wide association studies have identified over 70 common variants
    that are associated with breast cancer risk. Most of these variants map to non-protein-coding
    regions and several map to gene deserts, regions of several hundred kb lacking
    protein-coding genes. We hypothesised that gene deserts harbour long range regulatory
    elements that can physically interact with target genes to influence their expression.
    To test this, we developed Capture Hi-C (CHi-C) which, by incorporating a sequence
    capture step into a Hi-C protocol, allows high resolution analysis of targeted
    regions of the genome. We used CHi-C to investigate long range interactions at
    three breast cancer gene deserts mapping to 2q35, 8q24.21 and 9q31.2. We identified
    interaction peaks between putative regulatory elements (’bait fragments’) within
    the captured regions and ’targets’ that included both protein coding genes and
    long non-coding (lnc)RNAs, over distances of 6.6kb to 2.6Mb. Target protein-coding
    genes were IGFBP5, KLF4, NSMCE2 and MYC and target lncRNAs included DIRC3, PVT1
    and CCDC26. For one gene desert we were able to define two SNPs (rs12613955 and
    rs4442975) that were highly correlated with the published risk variant and that
    mapped within the bait end of an interaction peak. In vivo ChIP-qPCR data show
    that one of these, rs4442975, affects the binding of FOXA1 and implicate this
    SNP as a putative functional variant.

    restores incsulator functoin - CRISPR disruption of CTCF motif upregulates PDGFRA
  abstract: Gain-of-function IDH mutations are initiating events that define major
    clinical and prognostic classes of gliomas. Mutant IDH protein produces a new
    onco-metabolite, 2-hydroxyglutarate, which interferes with iron-dependent hydroxylases,
    including the TET family of 5’-methylcytosine hydroxylases. TET enzymes catalyse
    a key step in the removal of DNA methylation. IDH mutant gliomas thus manifest
    a CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP), although the functional importance
    of this altered epigenetic state remains unclear. Here we show that human IDH
    mutant gliomas exhibit hypermethylation at cohesin and CCCTC-binding factor (CTCF)-binding
    sites, compromising binding of this methylation-sensitive insulator protein. Reduced
    CTCF binding is associated with loss of insulation between topological domains
    and aberrant gene activation. We specifically demonstrate that loss of CTCF at
    a domain boundary permits a constitutive enhancer to interact aberrantly with
    the receptor tyrosine kinase gene PDGFRA, a prominent glioma oncogene. Treatment
    of IDH mutant gliomaspheres with a demethylating agent partially restores insulator
    function and downregulates PDGFRA. Conversely, CRISPR-mediated disruption of the
    CTCF motif in IDH wild-type gliomaspheres upregulates PDGFRA and increases proliferation.
    Our study suggests that IDH mutations promote gliomagenesis by disrupting chromosomal
    topology and allowing aberrant regulatory interactions that induce oncogene expression.

  title: Genetic dissection of the $\alpha$-globin super-enhancer in vivo
  container-title: Nature Genetics
  page: '895-903'
  volume: '48'
  issue: '8'
  abstract: Many genes determining cell identity are regulated by clusters of Mediator-bound
    enhancer elements collectively referred to as super-enhancers. These super-enhancers
    have been proposed to manifest higher-order properties important in development
    and disease. Here we report a comprehensive functional dissection of one of the
    strongest putative super-enhancers in erythroid cells. By generating a series
    of mouse models, deleting each of the five regulatory elements of the $\alpha$-globin
    super-enhancer individually and in informative combinations, we demonstrate that
    each constituent enhancer seems to act independently and in an additive fashion
    with respect to hematological phenotype, gene expression, chromatin structure
    and chromosome conformation, without clear evidence of synergistic or higher-order
    effects. Our study highlights the importance of functional genetic analyses for
    the identification of new concepts in transcriptional regulation.

  title: Gene complexity and gene duplicability
  container-title: Current Biology
  page: '1016-1021'
  volume: '15'
  issue: '11'
  abstract: Eukaryotic genes are on average more complex than prokaryotic genes in
    terms of expression regulation, protein length, and protein-domain structure \[1-5\].
    Eukaryotes are also known to have a higher rate of gene duplication than prokaryotes
    do \[6, 7\]. Because gene duplication is the primary source of new genes \[8,
    9\], the average gene complexity in a genome may have been increased by gene duplication
    if complex genes are preferentially duplicated. Here, we test this "gene complexity
    and gene duplicability" hypothesis with yeast genomic data. We show that, on average,
    duplicate genes from either whole-genome or individual-gene duplication have longer
    protein sequences, more functional domains, and more cis-regulatory motifs than
    singleton genes. This phenomenon is not a by-product of previously known mechanisms,
    such as protein function \[10-13\], evolutionary rate \[14, 15\], dosage \[11\],
    and dosage balance \[16\], that influence gene duplicability. Rather, it appears
    to have resulted from the sub-neo-functionalization process in duplicate-gene
    evolution \[17\]. Under this process, complex genes are more likely to be retained
    after duplication because they are prone to subfunctionalization, and gene complexity
    is regained via subsequent neofunctionalization. Thus, gene duplication increases
    both gene number and gene complexity, two important factors in the origin of genomic
    and organismal complexity. ??2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.

  title: Characterization of Apparently Balanced Chromosomal Rearrangements from the
    Developmental Genome Anatomy Project
  container-title: American Journal of Human Genetics
  page: '712-722'
  volume: '82'
  issue: '3'
  abstract: Apparently balanced chromosomal rearrangements in individuals with major
    congenital anomalies represent natural experiments of gene disruption and dysregulation.
    These individuals can be studied to identify novel genes critical in human development
    and to annotate further the function of known genes. Identification and characterization
    of these genes is the goal of the Developmental Genome Anatomy Project (DGAP).
    DGAP is a multidisciplinary effort that leverages the recent advances resulting
    from the Human Genome Project to increase our understanding of birth defects and
    the process of human development. Clinically significant phenotypes of individuals
    enrolled in DGAP are varied and, in most cases, involve multiple organ systems.
    Study of these individuals’ chromosomal rearrangements has resulted in the mapping
    of 77 breakpoints from 40 chromosomal rearrangements by FISH with BACs and fosmids,
    array CGH, Southern-blot hybridization, MLPA, RT-PCR, and suppression PCR. Eighteen
    chromosomal breakpoints have been cloned and sequenced. Unsuspected genomic imbalances
    and cryptic rearrangements were detected, but less frequently than has been reported
    previously. Chromosomal rearrangements, both balanced and unbalanced, in individuals
    with multiple congenital anomalies continue to be a valuable resource for gene
    discovery and annotation. 2008 The American Society of Human Genetics.

  volume: '29'
  issue: '10'
  abstract: Housekeeping genes are involved in basic cell maintenance and, therefore,
    are expected to maintain constant expression levels in all cells and conditions.
    Identification of these genes facilitates exposure of the underlying cellular
    infrastructure and increases understanding of various structural genomic features.
    In addition, housekeeping genes are instrumental for calibration in many biotechnological
    applications and genomic studies. Advances in our ability to measure RNA expression
    have resulted in a gradual increase in the number of identified housekeeping genes.
    Here, we describe housekeeping gene detection in the era of massive parallel sequencing
    and RNA-seq. We emphasize the importance of expression at a constant level and
    provide a list of 3804 human genes that are expressed uniformly across a panel
    of tissues. Several exceptionally uniform genes are singled out for future experimental
    use, such as RT-PCR control genes. Finally, we discuss both ways in which current
    technology can meet some of past obstacles encountered, and several as yet unmet
    challenges. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

  page: '462-70'
  volume: '507'
  issue: '7493'
  abstract: Regulated transcription controls the diversity, developmental pathways
    and spatial organization of the hundreds of cell types that make up a mammal.
    Using single-molecule cDNA sequencing, we mapped transcription start sites (TSSs)
    and their usage in human and mouse primary cells, cell lines and tissues to produce
    a comprehensive overview of mammalian gene expression across the human body. We
    find that few genes are truly ’housekeeping’, whereas many mammalian promoters
    are composite entities composed of several closely separated TSSs, with independent
    cell-type-specific expression profiles. TSSs specific to different cell types
    evolve at different rates, whereas promoters of broadly expressed genes are the
    most conserved. Promoter-based expression analysis reveals key transcription factors
    defining cell states and links them to binding-site motifs. The functions of identified
    novel transcripts can be predicted by coexpression and sample ontology enrichment
    analyses. The functional annotation of the mammalian genome 5 (FANTOM5) project
    provides comprehensive expression profiles and functional annotation of mammalian
    cell-type-specific transcriptomes with wide applications in biomedical research.

  abstract: Chromosomes are the physical realization of genetic information and thus
    form the basis for its readout and propagation. Here we present a high-resolution
    chromosomal contact map derived from a modified genome-wide chromosome conformation
    capture approach applied to Drosophila embryonic nuclei. The data show that the
    entire genome is linearly partitioned into well-demarcated physical domains that
    overlap extensively with active and repressive epigenetic marks. Chromosomal contacts
    are hierarchically organized between domains. Global modeling of contact density
    and clustering of domains show that inactive domains are condensed and confined
    to their chromosomal territories, whereas active domains reach out of the territory
    to form remote intra- and interchromosomal contacts. Moreover, we systematically
    identify specific long-range intrachromosomal contacts between Polycomb-repressed
    domains. Together, these observations allow for quantitative prediction of the
    Drosophila chromosomal contact map, laying the foundation for detailed studies
    of chromosome structure and function in a genetically tractable system.

  abstract: Enhancer-promoter regulation is a fundamental mechanism underlying differential
    transcriptional regulation. Spatial chromatin organization brings remote enhancers
    in contact with target promoters in cis to regulate gene expression. There is
    considerable evidence for promoter-enhancer interactions (PEIs). In the recent
    years, genome-wide analyses have identified signatures and mapped novel enhancers;
    however, being able to precisely identify their target gene(s) requires massive
    biological and bioinformatics efforts. In this review, we give a short overview
    of the chromatin landscape and transcriptional regulation. We discuss some key
    concepts and problems related to chromatin interaction detection technologies,
    and emerging knowledge from genome-wide chromatin interaction data sets. Then,
    we critically review different types of bioinformatics analysis methods and tools
    related to representation and visualization of PEI data, raw data processing and
    PEI prediction. Lastly, we provide specific examples of how PEIs have been used
    to elucidate a functional role of non-coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms.
    The topic is at the forefront of epigenetic research, and by highlighting some
    future bioinformatics challenges in the field, this review provides a comprehensive
    background for future PEI studies.

  title: Disorders caused by chromosome abnormalities.
  container-title: The application of clinical genetics
  publisher: Dove Press
  page: '159-74'
  volume: '3'
  abstract: Many human genetic disorders result from unbalanced chromosome abnormalities,
    in which there is a net gain or loss of genetic material. Such imbalances often
    disrupt large numbers of dosage-sensitive, developmentally important genes and
    result in specific and complex phenotypes. Alternately, some chromosomal syndromes
    may be caused by a deletion or duplication of a single gene with pleiotropic effects.
    Traditionally, chromosome abnormalities were identified by visual inspection of
    the chromosomes under a microscope. The use of molecular cytogenetic technologies,
    such as fluorescence in situ hybridization and microarrays, has allowed for the
    identification of cryptic or submicroscopic imbalances, which are not visible
    under the light microscope. Microarrays have allowed for the identification of
    numerous new syndromes through a genotype-first approach in which patients with
    the same or overlapping genomic alterations are identified and then the phenotypes
    are described. Because many chromosomal alterations are large and encompass numerous
    genes, the ascertainment of individuals with overlapping deletions and varying
    clinical features may allow researchers to narrow the region in which to search
    for candidate genes.
